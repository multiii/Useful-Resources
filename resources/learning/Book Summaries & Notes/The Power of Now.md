# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences

1. The present moment is all that we ever have, and by fully immersing ourselves in the Now we can connect to our deeper realm of Being and experience true happiness; although chasing goals may give our lives a direction, true happiness doesn’t come from attaining goals in the future (time) but instead in the Now.
2. Identifying with your mind and emotions is the root of most human problems, and by becoming conscious and accepting of our thoughts, feelings and inner energy we can remove negativity from our lives and attract only positive life conditions, by allowing the flow of life to work for you.
3. Your life conditions are merely the situations that you’re currently facing in the world of form, and they don’t affect the vibrant life of Being that exists underneath, and the permanent inner peace that connecting with it brings.

# 🎨 Impressions

This book is definitely a must-read, since it tackles some big philosophical and spiritual concepts that are truly life changing.

It offers new perspectives and insights onto the workings of the mind and the collective reality experienced by all humans, in order to teach us ways to completely remove negativity from our lives and always be at peace and “complete”, by savoring the present moment and accepting the flow of life

## How I Discovered It

My recollection of the memory is a little blurry but I’m pretty sure I read about this book on the comment section of a YouTube video, where the comment talked about how the book changed the commenter’s life.

When I first discovered the book, I had been feeling pretty empty, and was seeking a purpose and happiness for a while, since I thought I didn’t have worthwhile goals to chase. However, I think the problem was that I was looking for salvation in time (goals) instead of the present moment, and the book helped highlight this error.

## Who Should Read It?

I believe everyone should read this book at some point in their lives, since it’s definitely lifechanging in a major way. 

People suffering through a rut, a difficult time, or people who are just generally unhappy and unmotivated might benefit a little more from this book.

# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me

```
💡 How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.
```

- This book taught me to savor the present moment and be more conscious, after which I started making a tracker to note how often I’m conscious and observing the present moment everyday.
- The book also helped me to stop looking for salvation in goals and future events, and helped me start accepting the flow of life and find peace in everything that happens, instead of offering resistance to situations that I don’t like.
- This book gave me insights on the working of the mind, helping me realize that we are not our mind, and that unconsciously going through life by surrendering to your mind will be harmful in the long term, as it allows the conditioned, automatic thought patterns to fully run our lives.
- As a result of learning about fully immersing oneself in the present moment and feeling one’s emotions and feelings deeply, I’m pretty sure I was able to experience “conscious sleep” on a couple of occasions, which is when you can consciously witness your body falling asleep and remain conscious while asleep.

# ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes

> *If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time. You are
aware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your fullest attention to the step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into psychological time. Your life's journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to "make it." You no longer see or smell the flowers by the wayside either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds all around you when you are present in the Now.*
> 

> *Does it matter whether we achieve our outer purpose, whether we succeed or fail in
the world?
It will matter to you as long as you haven't realized your inner purpose. After that, the
outer purpose is just a game that you may continue to play simply because you enjoy
it. It is also possible to fail completely in your outer purpose and at the same time
totally succeed in your inner purpose. Or the other way around, which is actually
more common: outer riches and inner poverty, or to "gain the world and lose your
soul," as Jesus puts it. Ultimately, of course, every outer purpose is doomed to "fail"
sooner or later, simply because it is subject to the law of impermanence of all things.
The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment,
the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up
your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy, and you make it
subservient to your inner purpose.*
> 

> *Do you truly know what is positive and what is negative? Do you have the total
picture? There have been many people for whom limitation, failure, loss, illness, or
pain in whatever form turned out to be their greatest teacher. It taught them to let go
of false self-images and superficial ego-dictated goals and desires. It gave them
depth, humility, and compassion. It made them more real.
Seen from a higher perspective, conditions are always positive. To be more precise:
they are neither positive nor negative. They are as they are. And when you live in
complete acceptance of what is - which is the only sane way to live - there is no
"good" or "bad" in your life anymore. There is only a higher good - which includes
the "bad."*

# 📒 Summary + Notes

## 1. You Are Not Your Mind

- Enlightenment isn't something to be searched for, but instead exists within all of us.
- Enlightenment is a state of connectedness with yourself, finding your true essence and nature.
- The inability to feel enlightenment results in your fragmentation and seperation from the true self, in the form of the mind.
- Enlightenment is simply the eternal love and peace within, beyond the suffering and noise of the mind.
- Being is the eternal life present within, which cannot be understood but only felt when the mind is surrendered to it.
- The greatest obstacle to experiencing being is identifying with your mind, resulting in compulsive thoughts.
- To not be able to stop thinking is a disease; it's an addiction that is considered normal due to how common it is.
- Identifying with your mind creates an opqaue slate of concepts, labels, images, etc which block real relationships and creates a divide seperating you from nature, God, yourself and others.
- The mind is powerful when used purposefully; it is a problem when it uses you instead of you using it.
- You need to be able to stop thinking altogether, to experience the now and stop your mind from using you, and to attain freedom.
- You can begin to free yourself from your mind by observing your thoughts from within, but not consciously responding to it or judging it.
- When you're aware of yourself as the witness of thoughts, a new dimension of consciousness gets unlocked.
- When thoughts subside and you're one with your essence of Being, you have a gap of "no-mind".
- No-mind is a state of being alert, more awake and fully present.
- You can enter the no-mind by focusing in the present moment, by becoming intensely conscious of it: this is deeply satisfying to do.
- Thinking is necessary for survival, but most people have compulsory thoughts which are dysfunctional and harmful.
- The mind is to be used for specific tasks, but shouldn't be allowed to run unhindered 24/7 rendering useless thoughts.
- Compulsive thinking is an addiction since you don't have a choice to stop, and it gives you a false sense of pleasure which inevitably becomes pain.
- The addiction to thinking arises from us identifying with it; our mind always thinks in terms of the past and the future.
- Only when we let go of this thinking narrative, and focus fully in the present, can we truly liberate ourselves from our mind.
- Enlightenment is rising above thought, being in a much more focused state, allowing us to live creatively.
- Thought when it is let loose and disconnected from consciousness becomes barren, insane and destructive.
- All true artists create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness, where the mind guides them directly through a creative impulse. (This is the ASM from Psycho Cybernetics)
- Emotions and thoughts are all creations of the mind; emotions are a response of the body to the mind.
- When there is a conflict between mind and emotion, the feeling in the body will always be the true reflection.
- Observing our emotions is as important as observing our thoughts.
- Love and joy are not emotions, but instead the natural state of inner connectedness, which are activated only during gaps in the stream of thought: for eg, triggered by great beauty, extreme physical exertion, great danger, etc.

## 2. Consciousness: The Way Out of Pain

### Create No More Pain In The Present

- Nobody’s life is entirely free of pain, but the majority of human pain is unneccessary.
- The pain created in the present is always some form of unconscious resistance to what is.
- On the level of thought, it’s a form of judgement; on the emotional level, it’s a form of negativity.
- The degree of pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present, which in turn depends on how strongly you identify with your mind.
- The mind denies the present since it can only function with time: the past and the future.
- We need the mind and time to function in the world, but it shouldn’t take control over us.
- To remain in control, the mind masks the present moment with time, clouding the infinite creative potential of Being that is inseperable from the Now.
- We keep adding to a sum total of pain by rejecting the present and continuing to identify with the mind.
- To stop creating more pain, we need to stop adding more time than is necessary.
- To stop adding time, recognize that the Now is all that you ever have.
- We need to focus on the Now and pay brief visits to time, instead of doing the opposite as most people do.
- Be accepting of the present and let go of any resistance to the Now; by not opposing life, life works for you rather than against you.
- Even if the Now is unacceptable or unpleasant, observe it without judgement and watch how the mind labels it.
- By observing the mechanics of the mind, you can exit its resistance patterns and be accepting of what is.
- By allowing the present moment to be, you obtain freedom from external conditions and attain true inner peace.
- Always accept the present moment as if you had chosen it and work with it as a friend.
- By accessing the power of the Now, you allow life to work for you and transform your whole life.

### Past Pain: Dissolving The Pain-Body

- If you can’t access the power of the Now, every emotional pain will leave a residue that accumulates over time.
- All this accumulated pain throughout your life forms a negative energy field occupying your body and mind.
- This emotional pain-body can either be dormant or active.
- Anything can trigger this body, such as a thought or an innocent remark, especially if it resonates with a past-pain pattern.
- Some pain-bodies are obnoxious but harmless, while others are highly destructive and dangerous.
- Any form of unhappiness might be a sign of an awakening pain-body.
- The pain-body wants to survive, but it only does so if you unconsciously identify with it.
- Once it takes you over and “becomes you”, it will feed on negative energies to survive, such as anger, grief, hatred, emotional drama, violence, etc.
- You unconsciously start to seek more pain, becoming a victim or perpetrator, once the pain-body takes you over.
- When you consciously face the pain within you, it ceases to exist.
- By observing the pain-body directly and feeling its energy field within you consciously, the identification is broken and you become the watcher of it.
- When the pain-body cannot use you by pretending to be you, it can longer replenish itself through you, allowing you to access the power of Now.
- Unconsciousness creates the pain-body; consciousness transmutes this anti-life energy back to life energy.
- When we become the watcher, the pain-body will survive for a bit and try to trick you into believing in it—at this point it might even create physical pains—but it won’t last long.
- If you are present and consciously watching it, it will eventually no longer have control over your thoughts.
- Focus on the feeling inside you, know and accept that the pain-body is there, and then don’t think about it, judge or analyze it: continuing to stay present and observe will then lead you to harness the power of Now and extinguish this pain.

### Ego Identification With The Pain-Body

- Being able to be present and watch what happens inside you as the watcher provides you with the most powerful transformational tool.
- You most probably have believed that the pain-body is you for a long time, but this isn’t true.
- This belief creates an unconscious fear of losing your identity when you try to disidentify from this pain.
- This fear manifests itself in the form of a strong resistance, but it can be quickly broken down by observing it.
- By observing your peculiar pleasure you obtain from being unhappy, and your compulsion to talk/think about it, you can get rid of this resistance.
- By being alongside someone who is intensely conscious, you can accelerate this process.

### The Origin Of Fear

- Normal fear isn’t bad; psychological fear, i.e. fear unrelated to any true and immediate danger is the problem.
- Psychological fear comes in many forms: anxiety, worry, unease, tension, nervousness, phobia, etc.
- Psychological fear is the fear of something that ******might****** happen, and it causes your mind to be in the future.
- If you’re not living in the present moment, but instead identify with the mind, this resultant anxiety will be your constant companion.
- You cannot cope with this false mind projection of the future since it doesn’t exist.
- All such fear is ultimately the ego’s fear of death or annihilation.
- If the possibility of losing a debate causes fear, it’s because you identify with a mental position, and losing the debate means the mind-identified sense of self would be annihilated.
- By disidentifying from your mind, being right or wrong won’t make any difference to your sense of self.
- When you realize you’re defending a fictitious entity, the unconscious pattern will quickly dissolve.
- Power over others is weakness disguised as strength.
- Everyone who identifies with their mind has some level of fear, ranging from anxiety or dread to a vague unease and distant sense of threat.

### The Ego’s Search For Wholeness

- Another part of the emotional pain is the deep-seated sense of incompleteness.
- When conscious, it is in the form of an unsettling, constant feeling of not being worthy or good enough.
- When unconscious, it’s felt indirectly as an intense craving, wanting and needing.
- People fall into a pursuit of ego-gratification to fill this hole, striving after possessions, money, success, power, recognition or a special relationship.
- You cannot be at peace except during brief intervals when the egoic mind runs your life.
- Since the ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things, be fed and defended constantly.
- None of the identifications such as possessions, work, social status, knowledge, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, etc are you, but you shouldn’t believe that your identity cannot be found in any of those things.

## 3. Moving Deeply Into The Now

### Don’t Seek Your Self In The Mind

- You don’t need to learn a lot about the workings of the mind to attain spiritual enlightenment.
- The problems of the mind cannot be solved at the level of the mind; deeply studying madness isn’t enough to create sanity.
- The ego has endless needs and constantly experiences fear and want since it feels vulnerable and threatened.
- The ego loves problems as they strengthen its illusory sense of self.
- Studying the workings of the mind and exploring the ego’s countless manifestation creates just such a complex personal problem.
- Many people are deeply connected with their problems and unconsciously don’t want to be free of them, as that would kill their sense of self.
- By recognizing the root of unconsciousness as identification with mind and emotions, we can become present and step out of it, and live in the Now.
- The mind isn’t dysfunctional on it’s own; it’s a very powerful and useful tool.
- The mind becoms dysfunctional when you seek your self in it and mistake it for who you are, which allows it to take you over and become the egoic mind.

### End The Delusion Of Time

- You can disidentify from the mind by removing time from the mind.
- Identifying with your mind is being trapped in time: living almost exclusively through memory (past) and anticipation (future).
- You need to simply acknowledge and accept the present moment, allowing it to be.
- Time is an illusion: the past gives you an identity and the future holds the illusory promise of salvation and fulfillment.
- What’s precious isn’t time but the Now, because the Now is all there is, and it’s the only point that can take you beyond the limitless confines of the mind.

### Nothing Exists Outside The Now

- Everything happens in the Now; what you remember as the past is a memory trace of a former Now, and the future is an imagined Now.
- When you remember the past or think about the future, you do it now.
- Past and future are just pale reflections of the reality of Now.
- Shifting your consciousness in the Now takes you beyond the mind; everything feels alive, radiates energy and emanates Being.

### The Key To The Spiritual Dimension

- During life-threatening emergency situations, consciousness automatically focuses on the present moment; the egoic mind is replaced by an intense conscious presence.
- Some people love dangerous activities like mountain climbing as it forces them into the Now — the intensely alive state that is free of time, problems and thinking.
- Since ancient times, spiritual masters have believed that the Now is the key to the spiritual dimension.
- By being completely present in the Now, no problem, no suffering and nothing which is not part of your essence survives.
- “Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God than time.” — Meister Eckhart.

### Accessing The Power Of The Now

- Moving into the Now unlocks a new dimension, allowing you to feel the essence and spirit of everything, which cannot be felt by the mind.
- The mind is only concerned with facts, information, labels, and opinions, but it cannot know or feel something directly.
- The mind and mind knowledge is needed for practical day-to-day living, but it shouldn’t be allowed to take over all aspects of your life, as that makes it dangerous.
- It is necessary to make moving into the Now a common practice, by being present and accepting, and withdrawing attention from time.
- Observe the mind’s tendency to want to escape from the Now; you will observe that the future is imagined as better or worse than the present.
- If imagined as better, it gives you hope and pleasurable anticipation, but if imagined as worse, it creates anxiety.
- Use self-observation to be present, and watch your thoughts, emotions and reactions; witness not only the mind, but realize that you are the watcher of the mind.
- Whenever you watch your mind, don’t react, judge, or analyze, but simply observe and feel all that there is in an impartial manner.
- Situations that trigger a strong response, such as a threat to your self-image, a challenge, emotional complex, etc force a pre-programmed, unconscious response pattern to play out.
- During such situations, realize that everything that you do is the pattern and not you, and that identification with the mind gives it more energy.
- Observe the mind, the reactions and the emotions during such times; feel the energy within and move into the dimension of the timeless.
- Stepping out of time doesn’t impair your ability to use time for practical matters, and in fact it actually enhances your mind.

### Letting Go Of Psychological Time

- Time used for practical matters is clock time; it may be used to make an appointment, learning from the past or setting goals to work towards.
- Any lesson that we learn from the past, or any future plan is applied/made in the Now.
- Although the enlightened person focuses on the Now, they are always aware of clock time.
- You shouldn’t transform clock time into psychological time by dwelling on it and trying to “live” in it.
- Setting goals and working towards them uses clock time, but always focusing on the goals, due to seeking happiness, fulfillment and completeness in it results in a departure from the Now.
- By living in the future in this way for example, the Now becomes a mere stepping stone, and it starts to blind the true value of the Now.
- Time is an illusion, because at any moment the present is all that you will ever have and experience.

### The Insanity Of Psychological Time

## 4. Mind Strategies For Avoiding The Now

### Loss Of Now: The Core Delusion

- It’s okay to mentally accept the existence of time, since we need to only “live” the present and feel its vibrance.
- To be free of time is to to free of the past and the future, and let only the Now define your life.
- Loss of Now is a problem as it leads to a loss of Being.
- At first, you will shift from consciousness to unconsciousness, but eventually with time you will remain in the state of consciousness forever.
- By being aware of the fact that you lost the Now, you become present in the Now again.

### Ordinary Unconsciousness And Deep Unconsciousness

- Just like how we drift between different phases during sleep, humans often only drift between different states of unconsciousness.
- During ordinary unsconsciousness, people identify with their mind, thoughts and emotions, and there is always an undercurrent of a negative uneasy feeling of discomfort and tension.
- People use things like food, work, TV, alchohol, etc to get rid of the basic unease.
- In this state, you are run by the egoic mind and are unaware of Being.
- Deep unconsciousness is a more acute state of suffering and unhappiness.
- This state brings up intense negativity and often triggers the pain-body, and causes you to identify with it and its emotions.
- Your level of consciousness can be best identified with how you deal with life’s challenges; an unconscious person becomes more deeply unconscious, whereas a conscious person becomes more intensely conscious.
- It’s important to become more conscious in your everyday life, so that you can add to your power of presence.
- No negativity can survive in your power of presence and Being.
- When you first start being conscious and aware, the basic “static” of ordinary unconsciousness, and realizing how you’re never truly at ease might be surprising.
- This background “static” will be characterized by resistance in the form of judgement, discontent and mental projection away from the Now at the mind level, and unease, tension, boredom, or nervousness at the emotional level.

### What Are They Seeking?

- While unconscious, people can be described as always wanting something; this desire creates uneasiness and restlessness.
- Resistance to the Now results in a loss of awareness of Being.
- This collective dysfunction of resistance has resulted in a very unhappy and extraordinarily violent civilization.

### Dissolving Ordinary Unconsciousness

- To free yourself of suffering, make it conscious; observe without any judgement the ways in which unease, discontent and tension arise within you.
- Anything unconscious completely ceases to exist when the light of consciousness is shined on it.
- Ordinary unconsciousness may be hard to detect since it’s so normal; you can try to monitor your mental state frequently and ask yourself if you’re at ease at any given moment.
- When you monitor your mental state, observe, but do not judge, analyze or look for direct answers.

### Freedom From Unhappiness

- Try to observe within you even the slightest hints of resentment, observing the effects of it, thoughts generated by it, and the reactions in your body.
- Even if you have no choice towards your situation, you’re being taken advantage of, or anything else, what you’re doing is resisting what is: this makes the Now your enemy and creates unhappiness and conflict.
- No matter your situation, you shouldn’t be creating resistance and negativity.
- If you have resentment towards someone, either stop what you’re doing, speak to the person concerned and express what you feel fully, or drop the negativity which serves no purpose to you.
- The negativity generated during unfavorable conditions only strengthens a false sense of self, but this is destructive and polluting, and so should be removed immediately.
- Negativity can be dropped by letting go of it.
- Deep unconsciousness—the pain-body or some other deep pain—usually needs to be transmuted using acceptance and your conscious presence.
- Negative emotions are bad as your mind judged the Now as bad, which then created these emotions.
- We should always be accepting of the Now, and all the negative emotions we face, and then continue to be present and observe these emotions.
- We need to make sure not to allow the ego to convert acceptance into a label, allowing negative feelings to exist undisturbed however.
- When we have been practicing acceptance for a while, there comes a point when negative emotions are no longer created.

### Wherever You Are, Be There Totally

- Complaining about a situation is also ordinary unconsciousness, as it means not accepting what is.
- In such cases, you should either change the situation or accept what is; all else is madness.
- Ordinary unconsciousness is linked with denial of the Now; if the here and now makes you unhappy, remove yourself from the situation, change it or accept it fully.
- When removing yourself from the situation or changing it, you must drop your negativity first; action arising out of insight into what is required is more effective than action arising from negativity.
- Taking any action is better than no action; if fear prevents you from taking action, acknowledge it, watch it and be fully present with it to cut the link between the fear and your thinking.
- If you’re going to accept a situation, surrender to it; through surrender you can be internally free of the situation.
- If there’s something you “should” do but aren’t doing it, either get up and do it right away, or accept your laziness and procrastination in the Now.
- If you’re stressed, try to use the energy to live in the Now rather than resisting it, using the flow of energy to your present advantage.
- Stop thinking about the past, since it not only reinforces a false sense of self, but accelerates your body’s aging process.
- Worrying is pointless, because you cannot cope with the future; you cannot cope with something that doesn’t exist right now.
- If you keep focusing on the end-point of a goal, habitually waiting for it, you will never be truly satisfied.
- Reaching goals only provide a temporary feeling of salvation; by living in the Now you can realize that the state of Being is already perfect.
- You can strive to improve your life situation by setting goals, but the Life is already whole, complete and perfect, and can only be accessed in the Now.
- Never deny the present moment; come into the present moment and enjoy being, realizing that there is no need to wait for anything.

### The Inner Purpose Of Your Life’s Journey

- It’s important to have goals, but we should always be concerned primarily with our current step and our general direction; we shouldn’t focus on the end-goal more than the present moment.
- Your life’s journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose.
- The outer purpose is the goal that you set out to accomplish, but the inner purpose has to do with how you reach your goal: your quality of consciousness at this moment.
- If you focus on the destination more than the step you’re taking now, you completely miss the journey’s inner purpose.
- Your outer journey might contain a million steps, but the inner journey only has one: the current step.
- As you become deeply aware of this one step, you realize that within itself it contains all the steps that you need to take.
- The outer purpose only matters as long as you haven’t realized your inner purpose, but once you do, the outer purpose simply becomes an enjoyable game to be played.
- Achieving the outer purpose without realizing the inner purpose causes you to “gain the world and lose your soul”.
- Every outer purpose is doomed to fail since it’s temporary and cannot give you lasting fulfillment; the outer purpose should always be subservient to your inner purpose.

### The Past Cannot Survive In Your Presence

- Although the past defines your thought processes, you can find the unconscious past by observing the present you.
- You don’t need to understand the past, but simply observe your present mind, emotion, thoughts, and feelings which are a reflection of your unconscious past.
- The power of Now is the power of your presence and consciousness liberated from thought processes.
- Giving attention to the past energizes it and makes a “self” out of it; attention should be given to everything as it occurs in the present.
- As you become more conscious of your present reality, you gain insights on your reaction patterns as they are related to past events; this however, isn’t essential.
- Don’t seek to understand the past, but be as present as possible; the past cannot survive in your presence.

## 5. The State Of Presence

### It’s Not What You Think It Is

- The state of presence can’t be what you **think** it is, since it’s something that can only be experienced and not understood by the mind.
- During a state of intense presence, you are free of thought: still but highly alert.
- When your conscious attention goes below a certain level, the mental noise returns and you return to time as your mind gains control over you.
- To stay present it helps to be deeply rooted within yourself, by inhabiting your body fully and feeling your inner energy field.
- Feeling your body from within anchors you to the Now.

### The Esoteric Meaning Of “Waiting”

- The state of presence can be compared to a form of alert waiting, knowing that anything could happen at any time.
- During such a moment of being incredibly awake, none of your attention is spared for daydreaming, thinking, remembering or anticipating.
- You are present with every cell of your body and your “personality” ceases to exist, however you’re more fully yourself than you ever were before.

### Beauty Arises In The Still Of Your Presence

- The word *satori* describes a flash of insight: a moment of no-mind and total presence; it gives you a taste of enlightenment.
- Presence is needed to understand the beauty of nature.
- Beyond the physical forms, there is a greater essence in everything which can be felt when you are present.
- Moments when you experienced the beauty of nature, there was a moment of no-mind; if not, you wouldn’t have experienced it.
- The wider the time gap between perception and thought, the more depth there is to you as a human being.
- Because we live in such a mind-dominated culture, not everyone truly appreciates the beauty of nature, and most modern art, music and literature are devoid of inner beauty.

### Realizing Pure Consciousness

- Becoming conscious of Being is called presence.
- Since consciousness, Being and life are synonymous, presence means consciousness becoming conscious of itself.
- In the timeless realm of God, the beginning, the end and the essence of everything is eternally present in a state of perfection.
- In our world, timeless perfection cannot be conceived, nor can it be understood.
- Everything has some degree of consciousness; even a rock has a rudimentary form of consciousness, otherwise the atoms of the rock would disperse and fall apart.
- Consciousness is God expressing itself in form, and separate identities don’t truly exist for each form.
- In humans today, consciousness is completely identified with its disguise, and so lives in fear of annihilation of its physical or psychological form.
- The pressure of suffering caused by this apparent dysfunction will eventually cause consciousness to awake from its dream of form, regaining self-consciousness at a much deeper level than before.
- When you become present, you withdraw consciousness from mind forms and become the watcher.
- This strengthens the watcher and weakens the mental formations.
- Enlightened consciousness or presence is the freeing of consciousness from its identification with physical and mental forms.
- If we don’t free ourselves from our mind in time, we will be destroyed by it by experiencing increasing confusion, conflict, violence and madness.
- The collective egoic mind is the most dangerously insane and destructive entity on the planet.
- For the human race to survive, it must go onto a level of consciousness beyond the mind.
- Even if we don’t make it, it won’t matter on a cosmic scale; consciousness lost would just express itself as another form, so it is never truly lost.
- Silence is an important carrier of presence, so it’s important to notice the silence underneath the sounds.

### Christ: The Reality Of Your Divine Presence

- Words don’t really matter all that much; you could substitute “Christ” for presence if that’s more meaningful to you.
- There is no past or future in Christ, and so he said, “Before Abraham was, I am”.
- Presence entails living beyond the temporal dimension, in the dimension of no time.
- The “second coming” of Christ is a shift of human consciousness from time to presence, thinking to pure consciousness.
- Never personalize Christ, as that would create a false self manifested by the egoic mind.
- If you’re drawn to an enlightened teacher, it’s because you have enough presence in you to recognize presence in another.
- You must use the master’s presence to reflect your own inner identity and intensely present yourself; you will realize that presence isn’t personal, but it’s one.
- When highly present people come together, it generates an energy field of great intensity, thereby raising the degree of presence.
- Although group work is invaluable, you shouldn’t depend on it, or on any teacher.

## 6. The Inner Body

### Being Is Your Deepest Self

- The body can become a point of access into the realm of Being.
- The mind can’t **********understand********** Being, it can only be felt and experienced.
- Being is the deeply rooted state, abiding in which results in enlightenment.
- It makes you free from the illusion that you’re nothing but your physical self, as well as the fear and suffering inflicted by that illusion.

### Look Beyond The Words

- Don’t look into the words since they simply abstract the true meaning and essence of something.
- You could use a different word that gets you closer to a truth if that word works better for you to represent soemthing.
- As long as you are run by the egoic mind, you’re part of the collective insanity.
- Observe and watch without condemnation the suffering inflicted by humans on others and each other, as well as the root of insanity in your own mind.

### Finding Your Invisible And Indestructible Reality

- Identification with the outer body cannot take you into Being, but inhabiting the inner body essence within you does.
- Feeling the inner body energy from within takes you deeper into a journey of great stillness and peace.
- Underneath your physical form lies something immeasurable and sacred.
- When your mind takes up all your attention, you are cut off from Being.
- Compulsive thinking is a disease causing you to form your entire identity around your mind activity.
- This identity becomes a needy mental construct with fear as the predominant emotion, since it is cut off from Being, which then removes the awareness of your deeper self from your life.
- To become conscious of Being, you need to reclaim consciousness from the mind.
- Freeing consciousness from the mind releases large amounts of it which was previously being wasted in compulsive thinking.

### Connecting With The Inner Body

- You can connect with the inner body by directing your attention to it; feeling life in your body parts.
- You should give attention to this feeling without trying to create or view any image of it.
- The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless and unfathomable; you can always go into it more deeply.
- The inner body is your true essence, which you should never lose touch with.

### Transformation Through The Body

- Religions have condemed or denied the body due to denial of their animal nature.
- Humans hadn’t become conscious enough to accept their “animal nature”.
- Humans began dissociating from their body; they regarded themselves as having a body rather than being it.
- Religions further widened the gap between one and their body.
- People began to try to reach enlightenment by denying the body, but transformation is always through the body.
- All spiritual teachings originate from the same Source, but upon being written down as words lose their original meaning and essence.

### Sermon On The Body

- Your physical body is simply a misperception of your essential reality that is beyond birth and death.
- You shouldn’t fight against your body though, since that is equal to fighting against your own reality.
- The invisible inner body underneath the physical body connects you to the realm of Being, the Life Unmanifested.

### Have Deep Roots Within

- Staying in permanent connectedness with your inner body will help transform and deepen your life.
- At this higher energy level of consciousness, negativity no longer affects you.
- By keeping your attention in the body, you won’t lose yourself to the external world or the mind.
- Stay focused on the tasks you’re doing, but remain rooted within and hold attention in your inner body at all times too.
- Staying rooted within improves your level of consciousness and the quality of whatever you’re doing.
- Whenever you are waiting somewhere or spending time on commutes, use the free time to deeply go into the inner body.
- It is immensely easy to stay present as the observer of your mind if you’re deeply rooted within your body; nothing will be able to shake you anymore.
- Unless you stay present, you will continue to be run by the conditioned script in your mind.
- Whenever you face a challenge or something goes wrong, make it a habit to immediately go deep into your inner body.
- There is infinitely more intelligence in Being than in your mind.

### Before You Enter The Body, Forgive

- If you feel uncomfortable upon putting attention on the inner body, you must first deeply observe this lingering emotion.
- You shouldn’t try to think about it or label the emotion, but simply give attention to it and observe it.
- In a fully functional organism, emotions are like short-lasting ripples on the surface of Being, but when you’re not in your body, they can last for days or weeks, or combine with more negative emotions to become the pain-body.
- Place attention on the emotion and forgive it; offer no resistance to life.
- The alternatives to offering no resistance are pain, suffering, a restricted flow of life energy and in many cases physical disease.
- When you forgive and become present, entering the body, you feel the vibrant peace and stillness that emanates from Being.

### Your Link With The Unmanifested

- Presence is pure consciousness and being, and the inner body is the link to Being or the Unmanifested.
- When you become present, you reclaim consciousness from the mind.

### Slowing Down The Aging Process

- Although the physical body is affected by time, the energy field of the inner body always remains the same.
- By inhabiting the inner body and always being in the Now, your physical body feels clearer, more alive and grows old at a slower rate.
- More consciousness results in a reduction in the illusion of materiality.

### Strengthening The Immune System

- Being in the Now and in your body also strengthens your physical immune system and your psychic immune system.
- By strengthening your psychic immune system, negativity no longer affects you and simply phases through you.
- Systematically flooding different parts of your body with immense consciousness, before finally feeling the inner body in its totality is a very powerful self-healing meditation.
- The meditation helps boost your immune system, and is effective during the first symptoms of an illness.

### Let The Breath Take You Into The Body

- Focusing on the breathing first can be useful whenever it’s hard to get in touch with the inner body.
- Conscious breathing gradually puts you in touch with your own body, and using certain visualizations such as inhaling a light or luminous substance that you’re surrounded by can help.

### Creative Use Of Mind

- If you need to use your mind, use it in conjunction with your inner body.
- When you need an answer, a solution or a creative idea, focus on your inner energy field for sometime, and then continue thinking.
- Only if you can be conscious without thought can you use your mind creatively.

### The Art Of Listening

- When listening to another person, try to focus on your inner energy field, allowing you to listen from your whole body.
- Often people simply focus on their own thoughts, not focusing on the other person and their Being.
- The other person’s Being can only be felt through your own.
- Being in touch with your inner body creates a clear space of no-mind, allowing relationships to flourish.

## 7. Portals Into The Unmanifested

### Going Deeply Into The Body

- You can turn inhabiting your inner body into a 10-15 minute meditation to go into it more deeply.
- The goal is to feel the body as a single energy field, and then become it, thereby transcending the body.
- The formless realm of your inner energy is liberating, and gives you a sense of joy and intense aliveness.

### The Source Of Chi

- Chi is the body’s inner energy field, acting as the bridge between your body and the Unmanifested.
- By entering the realm of the Source, you take a glimpse at your real essence, which is not “of this world”, though it isn’t seperate from it.
- You should try to feel your inner body at all times, during everyday activities.
- The Unmanifested can always be felt as a stillness that never leaves you.

### Dreamless Sleep

- The Unmanifested provides you with vital energy every night when you sleep.
- Although your bodily functions are still operating, “you” no longer exist during dreamless sleep.
- You can use your inner body as a portal to enter the Unmanifested and stay connected with the Source.

### Other Portals

- The Now is the main portal into the Unmanifested, since you cannot be in your body without being intensely present in the Now.
- When you dissolve psychological time, you feel the radiant presence within your body, and within everyting else that you sense.
- Gaps of no-mind are also portals into the Unmanifested.
- When you’re intensely present, thinking automatically stops without being concerned about it.
- Letting go of mental-emotional resistance of what is—surrender—is also another portal into the Unmanifested.
- Inner resistance seperates you from the world around you, which is what the ego feeds on; the stronger the feeling of seperateness, the more you’re bound to the manifested.
- Love isn’t a portal, but it’s what enters from the other side from the portal.

### Silence

- By listening for the silence that comes before and after every sound, you can create inner silence and become present.
- Silence is an intrinsic part of every sound, and by recognizing it you can enter the Unmanifested, as the dimension of stillness grows within you.

### Space

- Just like sound is born out of silence, everything exists in the empty space that allows it to be.
- You can’t understand space, but you can use it to bring the Unmanifested into your life.
- Even if you withdraw everything from a room, the empty space makes it a room, so “nothing” is more important than what’s there.
- A shift in consciousness takes place when you become aware of all the space around you and feel it; if you shift attention from objects to the empty space, you can also shift your attention from mind objects.
- If some cosmic event destroyed the world, the Unmanifested would still exist.
- By connecting with the Unmanifested, you respect life for what it is, while realizing that everything is impermanent, thereby “[overcoming] the world.”

### The True Nature Of Space And Time

- Before the Big Bang, space didn’t exist as nothing was in it.
- Nothing can be without space, but space is nothing; although space is made up of vast emptiness, without anything it wouldn’t be empty, but just nothing.
- What appears to us as space is the Unmanifested itself, externalized.
- The stillness of space allows the universe to be—the same stillness that is even present within you, and is experienced during moments of no-mind.
- The perception of space of time are illusory, but they form the essential attributes of God: infinity and eternity.
- While space is the still, deep realm of no-mind, time is the presence and awareness of the eternal Now.
- When space and time are realized within as the Unmanifested, the world will no longer bind you.
- The ultimate purpose of the world lies within transcendence of the world, but it is needed for the Unmanifested to be realized, just like how space can’t be realized without the presence of objects in it.

### Conscious Death

- Apart from dreamless sleep, another involuntary portal is that which opens up briefly at the time of physical death.
- During near-death experiences, people see a radiant light or sense blissful serenity and deep peace.
- Most people turn away in fear seeing this portal, before losing consciousness, as they carry too much residual resistance, fear and attachment to sensory experience.
- If one’s presence isn’t strong enough for conscious immortality, there will be another round of birth and death.
- Your true nature is fully retained upon going through the portal; nothing that is real and of value is ever lost.
- Approaching death and death itself is a great oppurtunity for spiritual realization.
- Every portal causes a form of death, a death of the false self, and when you go through it you no longer derive your identity from your mind-made form.

## 8. Enlightened Relationships

### Enter The Now From Wherever You Are

- It’s not true that enlightenment can only come from love in a relationship, as that would mean you’d be waiting for a future event in time to save you; salvation can’t be in time but only in the Now.
- People pursue physical or psychological pleasures for gratification, to get rid of a feeling of fear or lack; this search for salvation from insufficiency causes nothing to ever fully satisfy them, and so they keep looking for something else in the future to save them.
- True salvation is fulfillment with your current self, to feel the good that has no opposite, the joy of Being that comes from within.
- True salvation is freedom from fear, wanting, suffering, and a perceived state of lack.
- People see time as the means to salvation, while it is actually the biggest obstacle to it.
- There’s nothing that can be done to get you closer to salvation than it is at this moment.

### Love/Hate Relationships

- Without consciousness, most relationships are deeply flawed and dysfunctional.
- Most “love relationships” become love/hate relationships, as they oscillate between the polarities of love and hate.
- It’s normal for relationships to be this way, and for couples to become addicted to these cycles: the drama makes them feel alive.
- When the balance between the polarities is lost and the negative cycles take over, the relationship eventually collapses.
- It may seem that removing the negative cycles would cure everything, but the two are different sides of the same coin: they are mutually interdependent.
- True love is something that has no opposite, and arises from beyond the mind.
- The negative side of a love/hate relationship can be seen as possessiveness, jealousy, control or withdrawal.
- On the positive side, you are deeply satisfied to be in love, as your existence has become meaningful: someone needs you, wants you and makes you feel special.
- However, there is also a neediness and clinging quality to that intensity, causing you to become addicted to the other person; the possibility of them not being there can lead to jealousy, possiveness, etc.
- Since love can change into an intense hostility or a profound grief quickly, it was actually just an addictive grasping and clinging.

### Addiction And The Search For Wholeness

- Romantic love relationshps are so universally sought-after, as they seem to free one from the conditions of fear, need, lack and incompleteness.
- On the physical level we’re never complete, as we are either a man or a woman: one half of the whole.
- On the psychological level, the ego creates a sense of lack and incompleteness, and as long as you identify with your mind, these feelings never leave, no matter how many sources of external gratification you gain.
- When you get into a relationship, the sense of lack and incompleteness seems to fade away at first, and everything becomes perfect for a while.
- Everything you used to derive your sense of self from now become useless, as the focal point of your life is now the relationship and the significant other.
- The feelings of lack and fear aren’t gone however, but they show up later, manifesting themselves in the form of the love-hate relationship.
- True love has no opposite, but ego attachment has both a positive and negative extreme.
- When your partner behaves in ways that doesn’t satify the ego, you lash out, as the feelings of lack come back, and it feels like your partner is the cause of these feelings.
- These relationships are merely an addiction, and all addictions help cover up pain.
- Although addictions help cover up pain, eventually there comes a time where the drug no longer works, and the pain is felt even more than normal.
- Every addiction arises from an unconscious refusal and fear to face one’s own pain; however, it’s quite easy to dissolve such pain by being present and conscious.
- Avoiding relationships to avoid pain isn’t the answer either; all that is needed is intense presence and consciousness.

### From Addictive To Enlightened Relationships

- An addictive relationship can be changed into a true one by being present and taking your attention deeply into the Now.
- By disidentifying from the mind and becoming the watcher of your thoughts, behavior and emotions, you can allow love to flourish.
- By no longer investing in “selfness”, the mind loses its compulsive quality to judge, which is what creates resistance, resulting in resentment, conflict and drama.
- The greatest catalyst for a relationship is to fully accept your partner, without needing to change them in any way.
- Love is a state of Being deep within you, not outside you; you can never lose this state.
- In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your inner energy field; you can also feel this life energy deep within every other human and creature.
- Love is not selective; exclusivity is not the love of God but the love of ego.
- There may be one person who reflects your love back to you more clearly and more intensely than others, and if that person feels the same toward you, it can be said that you are in a love relationship with him or her.
- The bond connecting you with that person is the same bond that connects you with all living creatures; only the degree of intensity with which it is felt differs.
- Even in an otherwise addictive relationships, there can be moments of true love during certain situations, when your Being is revealed, allowing true communication.
- True communication is the realization of oneness; this can only be sustained by being present and thwarting mind identification.
- Love can only flourish under deep presence intense enough to dissolve the pain-body, and freedom from mind identification.

### Relationships As Spiritual Practice

- Modern relationships reflect the deep state of crisis that humanity is facing.
- Since most humans now identify with their mind, most relationships are turbulent and turn into a source of pain and conflict.
- Many people are single or unable to establish a stable, intimate relationship, or willingly continue to stay in turbulent relationships.
- By accepting the fact that relationships activate and magnify the pain-body if they do, there is a sense of acceptance that frees you from the facts.
- By accepting the situation rather than running away from it, your knowing creates a safe-space that transmutes your non-peace into peace.
- Be glad when a relationship is not working, as by becoming conscious about the problem you gain an oppurtunity for salvation.
- By always knowing the reality of the moment, eg: anger, jealousy, defensiveness, etc, the relationship becomes your spiritual practice.
- If you react to your partner’s unconsciousness, you become unconscious; if you know your reaction however, nothing is lost since unconsciousness and knowing cannot coexist for long.
- If you accept that a relationship is here to make you conscious instead of happy, it will offer you salvation.
- Don’t wait for your partner to become conscious, or accuse them for being unconsciousness: judgement is either confusing one’s unconscious behavior for who they are, or projecting your own unconsciousness onto someone else.
- By remaining conscious and being the knowing, you can turn both your life and the relationship into a spiritual practice.
- Learn to express what you feel without blaming, to listen to your partner in an open way and give them space to express themselves fully.
- Some people who are cut off from their feelings may think they’ve attained enlightenment.
- By feeling your emotions, you can inhabit and merge with your inner body sooner rather than later.
- When things “go wrong”, someone who isn’t enlighened will have their unconsciousness take over them, manifesting in the form of anger, fear, etc.
- Every challenge contains within itself a disguised oppurtunity for salvation, if you can use it to your advantage to enter the Now.
- If you attain enlightenment while your partner is unconscious, they will either join you in that state or seperate away; consciousness and unconsciousness can’t coexist.

### Why Women Are Closer To Enlightenment

- It’s easier for a woman to feel and be in her body, making her closer to Being and enlightenment.
- To reconnect with the deeper quality of Being, you need qualities like nonjudgement and surrender.
- The mind’s energy frequency appears to be essentially male; while mind-energy is hard and rigid, Being-energy is soft, yielding, yet infinitely more powerful than the mind.
- In general, the major obstacle preventing enlightenment is the thinking mind for men and the pain-body for women.

### Dissolving The Collective Female Pain-Body

- The pain-body has a personal aspect, as well as a collective aspect directly connected to everyone’s personal pain-body.
- The collective aspect is the pain accumulated in the collective human psyche over thousands of years of war, torture, murder, disease, etc.
- People from certain countries facing extreme forms of violence have a heavier collective pain-body than others.
- Anyone with a strong pain-body and not enough consciousness will be forced to relive the emotional pain over and over again.
- Every women has a collective female pain-body which consists of accumulated pain of childbirth, child loss, slavery, etc over thousands of years.
- The emotional and physical pain arising out of menstruation is the awakening of the collective aspect of the pain-body.
- When a woman is taken over by the pain-body, it very strongly pulls them into unconscious identification with it.
- The number of conscious women who are approaching the fully conscious state exceeds that of men.
- The main task as a woman would be to transmute the pain-body so that it doesn’t stop you from becoming your true self.
- Only by detaching yourself from your pain and becoming conscious can you free yourself from it.
- The moment you realize that you’ve been attached to your pain is when you’ve broken the attachment.
- Before feeling the first signs of premenstrual tension, become very alert and fully inhabit your body; you need to alert enough to “catch” it before it takes you over when the first sign appears.

### Give Up The Relationship With Yourself

- The physical incompleteness of being either a man or a woman is felt as male-female attraction.
- In the state of inner connectedness, you feel this attraction only on the surface, whereas the real you inhabits the great depths of your inner energy field.
- Your form continues to have certain needs, but whether the needs are met or not are of little importance for you to feel whole.
- If your different sexuality helps you disidentify from socially conditioned patterns of thought and behavior, it could help you attain enlightenement, but it will be a hindrance if you form a new identity out of it.
- If you cannot be at ease with yourself when you’re alone, you’ll seek a relationship to be at ease; by accepting the moment fully, you can be whole in the Now.
- If you can be yourself without judging or resisting, giving up the relationship with yourself since a relationship needs two, all your other relationships will be love relationships.

## 9. Beyond Happiness And Unhappiness There Is Peace

### The Higher Good Beyond Good And Bad

- Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive, while inner peace does not.
- Nothing is truly positive or negative; a “negative” event can always have a positive outcome or vice versa.
- You should accept everything for what they are, realizing that nothing is either positive or negative.
- Whenever a “negative” event takes place like if a loved one has died, you cannot be happy but you can be at peace.
- If you’re in a situation that you can alter, you should do what you have to do while still accepting the present moment fully.
- By acceptance, you realize that all the perceived evil is part of the higher good that has no opposite.
- Acceptance is the gateway to transformation both within and without; whoever or whatever enters the field of consciousness that arises will be affected by it.

### The End Of Your Life Drama

- Most of the “bad” things are ego-created, and don’t come into your life when you’re fully conscious.
- Ego is the unobserved mind that runs your life in the absence of consciousness, and it has a tendency to cause negative things.
- The ego is incredibly clever, but it never solves any problems because it itself is the problem.
- Most people are in love with their life drama or negative events since they give them an identity to cling onto.
- No one who is fully conscious can have an argument or conflict with someone else.

### Impermanence And The Cycles Of Life

- In the physical dimension, physical pain and the law of impermanence still exist if you’re conscious, but you will fully accept them.
- When you’re conscious, you can still enjoy new circumstances and events, but you won’t be identified with them.
- According to the Law of Impermanence, nothing in this world ever remains the same; something that is “good” may become “bad” in the future, or may no longer exist.
- Happiness and unhappiness are in fact one; only the illusion of time seperates them.
- Seeking happiness from external things will elude you and never fully satisfy you.
- Offering no resistance to life allows you to always be at peace and be in a state of grace, ease and lightness.

### Using And Relinquishing Negativity

- All inner resistance is experienced and negativity.
- The ego believes that it can warp reality via negativity, and so, when you’ve identified with a form of negativity, you don’t want to let go.
- You can stop negativity from arising by becoming fully conscious.
- You can also stop it by fully accepting everything that you encounter by feeling yourself becoming transparent and allowing the disturbance to pass through you.
- Don’t look for peace or enlightenment in the future; don’t look for any other state than the one you’re in right now.

### The Nature Of Compassion

- Upon freeing yourself from the mind made opposites, you no longer get deeply affected by your life situation.
- True relationship only becomes possible when there is an awareness of Being.
- Compassion is the awareness of a deep bond between you and all other creatures.
- Since everyone and everything eventually dies, there will eventualy be total equality between you and all other creatures.
- Even after your mind-forms die, your divine presence is Radiant and fully awake.

### Toward A Different Order Of Reality

- The body exists because you believe in death; perceiving yourself as just a vulnerable body is the illusion.
- Your true nature is concealed somewhere within this illusion.
- The world around us depends on our consciousness and perception; diffeent people have different “sub-worlds” depending on their perspectives.
- Since all worlds are connected, when everyone reaches full consciousness, it will be reflected as a change in the world.
- Our collective reality is a representation of the collective human psyche.
- When humans become free from the ego, it will result in a shift in planetary consciousness and the “creation” of a new world.
- Your primary task should be to disidentify from form though, and not to seek salvation through creating a better world.’
- By becoming conscious and disidentifying from the mind and form, you start making a real contribution to the world.
- Wanting to alleviate suffering in the world is a very noble thing, but fighting it will only strengthen the unconsciousness; allow your conscious peace and compassion to flow through everything that you do instead.
- You must not fully focus on the world of form, but instead stay very alert and present; the causal level needs to remain your primary focus.

## 10. The Meaning Of Surrender

### Acceptance Of The Now

- We should yield to the flow of life and fully accept the present moment for what it has to offer.
- When your life situation is undesirable, you can work towards changing things, but you should do so while still accepting the immediate present and fully focusing your attention on it.
- Only by surrendering to a situation can you break the resistance pattern that keeps the situation going.
- In the state of surrender you won’t need any motivation to change things, since you will clearly see things and work towards changing them.
- If you cannot take yourself out of an unideal situation or change it, fully surrender to it and move even more deeply into the Now.

### From Mind Energy To Spiritual Energy

- To surrender to the Now, observe the resistance fully and feel the emotion completely.
- By witnessing resistance, you realize its futility and become free from it.
- You cannot be both conscious and unhappy.
- People are unhappy not because they’re conscious but because they’re identified with it.
- By surrender, the life conditions that were being resisted generally tend to shift quickly.

### Surrender In Personal Relationships

- Only an unconscious person can be manipulated.
- In a state of surrender, you can still “no” to people and things; such rejection must be driven by insight, not reaction.
- If you’re facing a situation that you cannot accept, immediately take action to change things or remove yourself from the situation.
- If you cannot take action, you can only either offer resistance and face suffering or offer acceptance and experience inner peace.
- Non-resistance must be mainly practiced in the inner life, and its effects will automatically show in external life.
- The ego believes resistance makes you strong, but it’s actually a weakness.

### Transforming Illness Into Enlightenment

- Surrender is fully accepting the flow of life during the Now.
- If you surrender when you’re suffering from an illness, you’re not surrendering to the illusory idea of an “illness”, but the specific feelings of discomfort that you’re facing right now.
- By accepting the flow of life, life works in your favor to aid you.

### When Disaster Strikes

- In general, only a major limit-situation such as a deep loss or disaster has the power to dissolve the ego and force one into surrender.
- Whenever a major disaster occurs in your life, know that there is another side to it; it can lead to something incredible and transformational.
- You won’t necessarily become happy in such a situation, but the pain within you will be transmuted into a deep feeling of peace, compared to which happiness is very shallow.
- With this radiant peace comes the realization of the deep truth that you’re immortal on the level of Being.

### Transforming Suffering Into Peace

- Whenever you face an unfavorable situation, it is not the situation that creates pain but your resistance to the situation.
- If you cannot accept the external situation, accept your inner emotions and pain fully to transform deep suffering into deep peace.
- When you try to escape emotional pain, everything you do becomes contaminated by it.
- Always face your pain and feel it fully without creating a script in your mind around it.
- Full attention is full acceptance and surrender.

### The Way Of The Cross

- Accepting deep suffering to find God is not the only way to enlightenment.
- You can attain enlightenment by mainly focusing on the Now
- If you think you need more time for enlightenment, you will get more time and more pain; time and pain are inseparable.

### The Power To Choose

- Some people seem to “choose” suffering, such as in the case of abusing relationships, but it’s actually a result of the mind’s conditioning.
- If you are run by your mind, you will suffer the consequences of your unconsciousness.
- By surrendering to the Now and becoming fully present, the past will no longer have power over you.
