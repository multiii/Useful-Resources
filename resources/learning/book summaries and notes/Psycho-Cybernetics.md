# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences

1. We all have an automatic and subconscious creative success instinct, allowing us to achieve any possible goal, if we effectively communicate our goal to that instinct, by deeply imagining and thinking about all angles of it, having a deep desire towards it and ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù the successful emotions as if you already achieved that goal (You can feel the emotions because your body cannot tell the difference between a real experience and one that is vividly imagined).
2. We should learn to calm our minds down and relax, get rid of anxieties and pressures by relaxing ourselves (we cannot feel any negative emotions when all our muscles are relaxed), and not try to consciously control creative actions, allowing your Automatic Success Mechanism to work for you, as we try to retain the normal state of happiness; we should also not shy away from mistakes, but instead learn from negative feedback, and also make use of our increased excited energy during crisis situations, realizing that the excitement isn‚Äôt negative anxiety but instead aims to help you succeed by providing you with more energy.
3. Our personalities and self-images aren‚Äôt set in stone, instead they are moldable and can be changed at any time; we should unlock our real personality, which is magnetic, attractive, dynamic and greatly uninhibited, and try to experience the ‚Äúwinning feeling of success‚Äù to accelerate our progress towards our goals, while having well-defined goals that we continue to strive towards (seeking goals increases our happiness since humans are goal-striving organisms).

## How I Discovered It

I discovered this book originally from a Google Drive containing PDFs of many self-improvement books. I also heard about this book from a self-improvement YouTuber named Hamza who talked about the immense benefits of following its visualization practices. A friend of mine also told me about the book and recommended it to me sometime later, which eventually led me to start reading it.

# üìí Notes + Summary

### Chapter One: The Self-lmage: Your Key to Living Without Limits

- Everyone carries a mental image of themselves within them formed by the their past experiences, successes and failures, which is called the self-image.
- The self-image dictates what someone can and can‚Äôt do, what is easy and what is difficult or even how others respond to them.
- The self-image keeps people at the level they perceive themselves to be at; you cannot escape or outperform your self-image.
- You cannot outperform your self-image since your previous experiences trick you into believing that it isn‚Äôt possible, and when you fail at doing so it only reinforces that very thought.
- Changing your habits, personality, or way of life can only be done by first changing your self-image.
- To find life reasonably satifsfying, you must have a self-image that you accept and like, allowing you to express yourself and not feel shame or dissatisfaction with yourself.
- What everyone wants deep down is more life (aliveness), i.e. living a life where you aren‚Äôt bounded by the restrictions of your self-image.
- The subconcious mind is actually a servo-mechanism which is directed by the conscious mind; it is an automatic goal-striving machine which works in your favor if you set goals of success.
- It can be beneficial to watch, follow, and study the people who are living as you aspire to live, and have the characteristics you want to improve upon.

### Chapter Two: How to Awaken the Automatic Success Mechanism Within You

- The human brain is much more complex than a computer, but functions on the same basic principles.
- Just like how birds have a survival instinct which lets them migrate safely across thousands of miles during the winter even without any prior knowledge, humans also have a survival instinct allowing them to automatically achieve goals which haven‚Äôt been achieved before.
- Our survival instinct is extremely powerful since we can set our own goals for our goal-striving mechanism to automatically achieve, which isn‚Äôt possible for other animals.
- Our automatic success mechanism makes use of past experiences to automatically achieve a goal, e.g. we can pick up a pencil without controlling each muscle to appropriately contract; the mechanism automatically does it for us.
- For our servo-mechanism, the process of solving a problem or finding a new idea is similar to remembering a name that you forgot.
- Our servo-mechanism can automatically solve problems for us, even when we are consciously doing other tasks (even if we‚Äôre sleeping!).
- Imagination allows your servo-mechanism to find solutions, even by using information which isn‚Äôt even stored in your own mind.
- It is possible for you to ‚Äúdiscover your potential‚Äù, and drastically improve your life by improving your self-image since every human is literally ‚Äúengineered for success‚Äù.

### Chapter Three: lmagination: The Ignition Key to Your Automatic Success Mechanism

- Imagination can cause us to perceive things to be much different than they actually are, which can sometimes be a detriment to your self-image.
- We act, feel and perform in accordance with how we **************************imagine************************** ourselves and our environment to be.
- Imagining something to be true causes even our entire body to respond in accordance, even if it might not be true. (Hypnosis works on this very principle)
- Our nervous system cannot tell the difference between a real experience and one that is vividly imagined.
- Since our nervous system and brain respond to the environment based on how we imagine it to be, using mental pictures to imagine us in a favorable condition primes the brain to act how it would if we actually were in such a condition.
- When you use visualizations, imagination and mental pictures, you can communicate with your body and make it respond, thereby altering the body‚Äôs autonomic physiological responses.
- Mental pictures and vivid imagination allow you to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù for an upcoming event in a very real and effective way.
- When you imagine your goal vividly in your mind, your automatic success mechanism takes over and does the job much better than you could with conscious effort or willpower.
- Religion says that humans have been made to succeed, and express themselves fully, which is actually substantiated by the fact that the human brain is engineered for success; there should be no reason you can‚Äôt change yourself and become your ideal, true self.
- Use imagination pictures to vividly imagine yourself as your perfect self, acting exactly how you want yourself to. Make use of all five senses, and make it as detailed as possible for the next 30 minutes. This implants new memories into your midbrain, and after enough time, you will automatically begin acting how you imagined yourself to.
- Effectively using this ‚ÄúTheater in the Mind‚Äù practice, you can alter your personality to how you want it to be. Start by writing down a brief outline of the movie you want to construct and experiment with, then spend the next 30 minutes vividly imagining it, and then over time gradually alter the movie so you act exactly how you want to, and continue to do so for the next 11 days.

### Chapter Four: How to Dehypnotize Yourself from False Beliefs

- False beliefs about yourself that you firmly believe to be true, will cause you to act and behave in accordance to them, effectively hypnotizing you.
- Such hypnotization can directly affect your physical state too, as in the case of one man who looked like he aged 20 years practically overnight.
- Hypnosis doesn‚Äôt just prevent someone from trying to do something, but it renders them incapable of actually doing it.
- Hypnosis via belief can hence be used to convince yourself that you can be your ideal self, and then actually make you behave as such.
- Feelings of inferiority don‚Äôt arise from facts which prove that you‚Äôre inferior to someone in some regard, but instead by your conclusions of the facts; by setting the bar at someone else‚Äôs norm, which automatically makes you second best.
- Striving for superiority also causes more trouble and causes more frustration; inferiority and superiority are two sides of the same coin, and so it‚Äôs important to realize that no two people are the same, and you are neither inferior nor superior, but you are just ‚Äúyou‚Äù.
- Measuring your total worth against someone else‚Äôs standards is like comparing apples to oranges, since no two people are the same; they can‚Äôt measure up to yours and neither can you measure up to theirs.
- You can make use of appropriate mental pictures to physically relax yourself, to calm yourself down and have a relaxed attitude, which will help you better control your automatic mechanism, as well as dehypnotize you from negative reaction and thought patterns.

### Chapter Five: How to Succeed with the Power of Rational Thinking

- Your conscious thoughts have direct control over your automatic subconscious mechanism.
- You don't have to dig up past memories and challenge long held notions to make changes in your behavior and lead a more ideal life, as the portayal of therapy in media may suggest.
- Rational thinking about and deciding your goal, and then communicating it to your servo-mechanism via imagination and visualizations help you achieve that goal.
- Many people who think they can't make the changes they want to, simply **feel** that way, but rationally thinking about it would prove that conclusion to be false.
- You don't need to cling onto past failures and errors, since although they are useful to you in the sense that the process of trial-and-error is what helps you scope for success, it is no longer required to think about them once they are over.
- To change automatic reaction patterns, you need to use your conscious beliefs to make a strong impression on your subconscious, and pull up by the roots the subconscious beliefs and reactions which do not serve you. Conscious rational thinking gives you the power to prime your automatic mechanism how you want it to act.
- Ideas are changed by other ideas, and this change using ideas can be facilitated by making use of rational conscious thought.
- It is important to rewire your beliefs to serve you using your conscious thought, and to do so, you can ask yourself a few questions:
    - Is there any rational reason for such a belief?
    - Could it be that I am mistaken in this belief?
    - Would I come to the same conclusion about some other person in a
    similar situation?
    - Why should I continue to act and feel as if this were true if there is no
    good reason to believe it?
- Being angry and annoyed at your inability to use your potential and change your beliefs, and deeply feeling a desire and enthusiasm for what you wish you could do (along with visualizing that success) can be used to effectively communicate goals to your automatic mechanism.
- Rational thought helps you filter information and feed positive data that will serve you, and reason as well as question your thoughts, beliefs, and external input to most effectively communicate your goals and wants to your subconscious.
- We need to use rational thinking to achieve perspective, gain a clearer sense of any situation, let go of mistakes, develop new mental pictures in the imagination, and fuel up the success mechanism.
- It's important to use your concious rational thinking to assess any situation, and prevent your subconscious from hastily accepting and reacting to negative input, by forming logical, rational and correct conclusions while taking all facts and evidences into consideration.
- Make sure not to focus on what you don't want (the negatives), but instead deeply, vividly focus on what you want (the positives) to signal and feed the right inputs to your success mechanism.
- Make sure to use your conscious mind to pay attention to the task at hand, and maintain focus, but don't expect it to do all the work for you, since that is for the subconscious; the concious mind is needed to send positive inputs of success to your automatic mechanism.
- You need to put trust into your subconscious success mechanism, since you cannot see it in action directly, but by putting trust into it, you more effectively communicate to it your needs and goals for it to work towards.
- You can ask yourself a few questions help get rid of problems in your life that you wish to resolve and change, but aren't able to. ("Is there any rational reason for such a belief?‚Äù, followed by the other 4 questions already listed above)

### Chapter Six: How to Relax and Let Your Automatic Success Mechanism Work for You

- Life doesn't need to be filled with stress, and we can easily get done with work and tasks without being stressed out by them.
- Stress can be eliminated by assigning problems to your success mechanism and dismissing all responsibility instead of trying to do everything using your conscious mind.
- Being too careful and focusing entirely using conscious thought causes worry, anxiety and fear, preventing your subconscious mind from working on the task.
- The fact that creative thinking and doing works is proven by the fact that artists, poets and other creative workers don't consciously focus on doing their work, but instead receive insipirations that help them continue their work.
- Creative thinking not only applies to creative workers, but also to the common man in solving day-to-day problems.
- Improving your skill in any performance follows a structured pattern of learning, but this can be greatly accelerated by using Theater in Your Mind techniques instead of physical trial-and-error.
- Consciously focusing on your task and trying to apply effort jams your creative machinery, preventing it from automatically doing your work.
- Whenever you make a decision, stop caring about your decision and solely be concerned with supporting it and being happy about it, to allow your creative mechanism to proceed.
- Always focus on the here and now, and do only one thing at a time, since your creative mechanism works on spontaneous input and can only work in a linear fashion.
- Try to relax between bouts of work to reduce stress and become better at handling stressful situations.
- Although success is supposed to be difficult to achieve, it need not be stressful. So, make sure you relax and don't apply conscious effort on doing a task, delegating it to your creative mechanism instead.

### Chapter Seven: You Can Acquire the Habit of Happiness

- Happiness is physical medicine for the human body and causes your organs to function better.
- Happiness is the normal, native state of the human mind, and it isn't something that's earned or deserved.
- Persuing happiness is not selfish, and being unhappy yourself doesn't help those who are already unhappy.
- Any one event or incident in the future that you're looking forward to cannot automatically take you from being unhappy to happy; if you are happy at all, you must be happy not because of something but just be happy.
- Happiness is a mental habit that can cultivated by reacting to as many incidents as possible positively and with an optimistic attitude.
- By accurately and calming seperating fact from fiction, and fact from opinion, you can cause your reactions to be solely based on truth, thereby increasing your happiness.
- Having a goal-striving attitude increases happiness, and often it is the loss of a goal that causes unhappiness.
- By aggressively and positively reacting to threats and problems, and always maintaining a goal-oriented mindset, you can greatly improve your happiness habit.
- You need to take responsibility for your own happiness, and consciously work towards altering your thoughts and causing it, rather than wait for something to happen to make you happy.
- You can try to imagine/visualize writing down your negative thoughts on a piece of a paper, and them crumpling it up and burning it by lighting it on fire, to remove negative thoughts from the mind.
- You must sacrifice old unproductive yet comfortable habits and beliefs to be happy, and this is needed to do because although these habits don't serve you, the comfort of having held them for so long causes reluctance to move, which needs to be active fought against.
- Actively cultivating the habit of happiness, by focusing on the present, and only keeping happy thoughts have such benefits such as improving your health and medical conditions, allowing you to realize 'dreams' and achieve contentment according to some accounts.
- Remembering pleasant ideas and memories, as well as randomly smiling once in a while in addition to the previously mentioned exercises can help you cultivate the happiness habit quicker and easier.

### Chapter Eight: Ingredients of the "Success-Type" Personality and How to Acquire Them

- Your personality can determine if you're going to find success or come to failure.
- To attain success (and cultivate happiness), you need to have a sense of direction towards your clearly-defined goals, and should constantly to striving to achieve new goals.
- You need to have a good understanding of your environment, and be willing to see the truth for what it is, without affecting the facts with your hopes or opinions of them.
- You should be aware of your mistakes as well as your successes, but realize that your failures don't constitute you, and that learning from negative feedback is what helps any servo-mechanism succeed.
- You should have the courage to act towards goals, be ready to commit mistakes and take risks. Be ruthless in your pursuit of your goals and never wait for the perfect time to make a move, because it's never the perfect time.
- Making a mistake is still better than not taking action, so forget all your excuses and commit to taking action without being scared of the consequences, since in due time you will achieve your goals with consistent action.
- Have respect for other people and treat them with kindness and charity, since when one begins to feel more charitably about others, he invariably begins to feel more charitably toward himself.
- Never doubt yourself, and realize that you always have the potential to achieve your goals. Learn to celebrate your victories and realize that you aren't your mistakes.
- Use your mistakes as a way of learning, and then dismiss them from your mind; all servo-mechanisms require negative feedback to succeed, so be confident in your ability and potential to do so with due time.
- Accept yourself for who you are and be happy and content with yourself. No violin is imperfect because it sounds a sour note, and similarly you aren't your mistakes; celebrate your wins and improve your self-image to fully utilize your true potential and allow your subconscious to work in accordance to your goals.
- Strive for self-acceptance, realizing you're unique, with strengths, weakness, knowledge and ignorance, experience and naivet√©; be yourself, while also engaging in self-directed self-improvement to get closer towards realizing your potential.
- Someone with a high AQ (measurable part of self-image) doesn't blame others for his adversities or setbacks, but also doesn't blame himself, but instead believes that his problems are small and short-term, and can be dealt with.
- Make sure to not carry around emotional burdens that weigh you down; it isn't the burdens that are directly causing you pain but instead your lack of awareness of them.

### Chapter Nine: How to Avoid Accidentally Activating Your Automatic Failure Mechanism

- Your servo-mechanism is powerful far beyond your past experiences would lead you to believe, and you'll be amazed at its capabilities.
- When used productively, this power acts as an Automatic Success Mechanism, but similarly it has a destructive potential, expressed as the Automatic Failure Mechanism.
- We need to make sure to regulate the power of our servo-mechanism by looking for negative emotions and correcting course.
- Frustration is a common feeling when an important goal cannot be realized or some plan is thwarted, which can be fixed by realizing that the goals you've set for yourself are unrealistic and/or you have an inadequate self-image.
- Being frustrated at something doesn't solve problems and help you attain goals, so instead focus on accepting yourself and your mistakes, and then strengthen your self-image, effectively picking yourself back up to then replot your course.
- Aggressiveness is necessary to work towards a goal, however there is a problem when we are blocked from achieving our goal, as then the aggressiveness seeking an outlet, becomes a destructive force when misdirected or unused.
- Focus on concentrating your fire, and using your aggression to vigorously chase your goals in an efficient manner, rather than lashing out blindly; misdirected aggression is an attempt to hit one target (the goal) by lashing out at any target.
- Make use of physical exercise and writing as a safety valve for your excess of emotional steam and aggresiveness.
- Insecurity stems from the unfair comparison of yourself to an ideal, perfect or absolute self, without trying to reach for such goals.
- Ridding yourself of insecurities can be done by rationally thinking about the situation and other people involved, or about yourself, or by self-image reassurance and strengthening, including Theater of Your Mind practices and sending your ASM on searches for needed answers.
- Always strive to achieve new, better goals, rather than defend your current position, as standing at the top of a pinnacle is insecure; by establishing your superiority, there is no need to try, hence causing you to lose your will to win.
- The chronic lonely feeling of being cut off from other people is the work of the AFM, which can be remedied by forcing your to mingle with others.
- Uncertainty is a way of avoiding responsibilities, by falsely believing that if no decision is made, nothing can go wrong.
- The truth is that even the most seemingly perfect individuals make mistakes, and failure is necessary for success, since servo-mechanisms correct course using negative feedback, so avoiding responsibilities makes no sense since making mistakes is necessary to correct course towards success.
- Resentment is making up excuses and blaming others to make our own failure palatable, but it's a cure that's worse than the disease; it creates a satisfaction but doesn't change anything, and it creates an inferior self-image.
- Resentment is caused by your own emotional response, not by other people, and although your resentment can be valid, it won't help you succeed, which means by all means you need to take constructive actions to attain happiness and success.
- Emptiness is the lack of capacity to enjoy life in general, due to success in spite of frustration, resentment, etc.
- The secret to keeping your AFM asleep, is fixing worthwhile goals, as that is what makes your life worthwhile; emptiness is a symptom of not living creatively and striving towards goals important to you or a purpose.
- It's necessary to glance at negative feedback, but don't let them weigh you down, and focus on positives instead.
- Take a few minutes at the end of each day to congratulate yourself on all your ASM reflective actions, but take note of AFM warnings and tell youself that the AFM wasn't you, and such behavior won't be tolerated; don't fear self-analysis, but instead identify positives you can build on and the recommitment to your goals.

### Chapter Ten: How to Remove Emotional Scars and Give Yourself an Emotional Facelift

- We form emotional scars when hurt, offended or embarased, just like how we form physical scars when hurt physically.
- Emotional scars can make people over-protective, causing them to be alienated from life.
- Your self-image is never set in stone, and can be altered to how you want it to be at any time.
- You should be okay with occasional disappointment, rejection and mistakes, while realizing that they won't deter you from your goals.
- Emotional scars can deeply affect one's life in a negative way, but they can easily be removed without having to revisit past memories.
- You can immunize yourself from future emotional scarring, by having a better self-esteem and self-image, preventing you from being affected by small threats to your ego, or even real digs and cuts.
- A person with a good self-image, who is self-reliant and responsible is never affected by emotional hurts or injuries; rather than being needy for appreciation and consideration, be self-reliant and admire your own good work and achievements.
- Negative feelings such as those of offense are caused by our response, but by relaxing the muscles of our body, it becomes impossible for us to feel negative emotions.
- To remove old emotional scars, you need to practice real and genuine forgiveness (although it is difficult and takes time).
- Make sure to not use forgiveness as a weapon, but because your condemnation does you no good.
- Make sure to not only forgive others, but also yourself, since you cannot see your future with optimistic eyes if you cannot see your past with kind eyes.
- Realize that you make mistakes, your mistakes don't make you; a toddler who keeps failing while learning to walk isn't labelled a failure, hence so shouldn't you whenever you make mistakes.
- We should be willing to be a little vulnerable, to live creatively and have fun in life; although we run the risk of being hurt, we could never enjoy the joys without being a little vulnerable.
- An emotional facelift can make you look younger and be healthier, and you can do so by relaxing negative tensions, therapeutic forgiveness, being self-reliant and having a good self-image, and living creatively: being willing to be a little vulnerable, along with having a nostalgia for the future.

### Chapter Eleven: How to Unlock Your Real Personality

- Everyone has a magnetic, attractive and dynamic personality within them.
- People love babies for being their authentic selves, for being *themselves*, and expressing their real feelings fully.
- Everyone has a dynamic personality within them, and those who don't express it simply have an inhibited personality waiting to be unlocked.
- Inhibited personalities are a result of restricting one's real self from shining, due to excessive negative feedback, resulting in symptoms like shyness, hostility, excessive guilt, nervousness, insomnia, being unsociable, etc.
- Negative feedback aims to make you stop what you're currently doing and do something else, not to make you stop completely, yet excessive negative feedback can wrongly lead some to do just that.
- When a lost hiker catches himself walking in a wrong direction towards a tree near his car, he doesn't think it's wrong for him to continue walking since he made a mistake, yet many of us are guilty of concluding the same at negative feedback.
- Often people respond too sensitively to negative feedback, and are consciously overcritical of themselves or try to be too careful to avoid errors, which causes problems.
- For negative feedback to be effective, it must be spontaneous, automatic (sub-conscious), and the response to it shouldn't be so sensitive that it causes inhibition.
- Care should be taken not to overly emphasize a flaw, as otherwise it could be wrongly taken as the goal by the servo-mechanism.
- Conscious self-criticism makes you do worse, because of the nature of excessive negative feedback being detrimental.
- We require gentle course-correction feedback, to remind us that we are doing the right thing by doing something, even if it's wrong, since a servo-mechanism reaches a goal by making mistakes and correcting them.
- Gentle course-correction feedback motivates us to keep going rather than inhibiting us, and by applauding us at each small victory, it keeps us on course and directed towards the goal.
- We may need to find environments to operate without inhibition or fear, to prove to our self-images that we are competent under the right circumstances, causing us to trust our ASM more to deliver peak performance.
- Consciously focusing too much or being too careful is a form of excessive negative feedback, resulting in inhibition.
- Always trying to be perfect and matching a high standard causes inhibition; it doesn't make sense, in fear of speaking wrong, to never speak at all. Always express yourself more and course-correct along the way instead of trying to fake yourself already being perfect via inhibition.
- Most people prefer authentic, to "forcibly inhibited", so you should focus on expressing yourself more rather than being too careful to match a "perfect" ideal.
- If you often consciously think about how other people perceive you, it also functions as excessive negative feedback which will only harm you; receiving feedback from others must be subconscious, automatic and spontaneous to be effective.
- By ignoring excessive negative feedback, or anxiety from strange situations, we can improve our performance and composure: this is called poise.
- You need to be less concerned with how others think of yourself, and more concerned with how you feel, think of and express yourself.
- Unless you're controlled by the thoughts of others, you can do anything you set your mind to, as your strong self-image will guide your ASM to work tirelessly towards your goal. It is only when you no longer believe in yourself that you are in truly dire straits.
- Your opinion of yourself matters most of all, and if you believe in yourself, your self-image and ASM will automatically bring you to a more fulfilling life.
- The goal of conscience is to make you happy, but seeing self-expression from a moral or ethical perspective, might directly contradict that. Self-expression might be morally wrong if you've been punished as a child for speaking up and expressing your ideas; self-expression is hence, not a moral issue.
- If you have an inhibited personality and want to lead a more fulfilling life, you need to practice disinhibition and express yourself as much as possible.
- Everyone does need a certain amount of inhibition, and no inhibition is bad, but for someone with an inhibited personality, disinhibition is of utmost importance.
- You might need inhibition if you find yourself in hot water because of ill-considered actions often, if projects backfire on you for acting first and asking questions later, if you can never admit you're wrong, if you're a loud talker and a blabbermouth.
- If you feel inadequate, worry a lot, are anxious, overly concerned, and/or nervous, feel self-conscious, or have difficulties in going to sleep, or if you feel ill at ease in social situations and constantly hold yourself back and take a back seat, you need disinhibition.
- To practice inhibition, don't wonder in advance what you're going to say, act before you think and correct your actions as you go. Stop critcizing yourself and instead encourage yourself for taking action. Make a habit of speaking louder than usual, and don't be afraid to express your emotions: let people know when you like them, make compliments often and do acts of kindness.

### Chapter Twelve: Do-It-Yourself Tranquilizers that Bring Peace of Mind

- Our feelings don't depend on externals, but on our own attitudes and reactions to stimuli.
- Overresponding to stimuli by being nervous or anxious is a bad habit, that can be cured; when a telephone rings, we normally stop what we are doing to go pick it up, however we can choose to ignore it.
- You don't have to react to external stimuli, you can choose to ignore them and remain relaxed, continuing to do what you were doing; the signal doesn't have power over you.
- Your failure to respond doesn't require you to make an effort, or resist or to fight, but to do nothing and simply relax.
- You have the power to consciously stop yourself from responding to situations; you can break the connections if you so choose, creating a new habit of not responding.
- You can extinguish conditions responses if you make a practice of choosing to relax instead of responding.
- If you cannot ignore responding to something, try delaying it instead, saying to yourself that you will respond to it, but later rather than right now.
- Our disturbed negative feelings are caused by our own responses, causing a tension in our muscles, but by relaxing our muscles perfectly we cannot feel any negative emotions.
- Everyone has a point of relaxation in their mind, and one can access this point by visualizing a safe decompression room in your mind, with all the right decorations, furniture and all the vivid details one could imagine, to retreat into whenever they need to rest and recuperate.
- Whenever you have a few spare moments in the day, practice escapism by calming down in your imagined relaxation room and leaving behind all your worries. You can also imagine blowing off steam from a steam valve atop your head whenever your tense or not at ease.
- Before undertaking a new problem or task, you must clear your ASM from your previous task, as if you carry-over parts of your previous task, it can give you a wrong answer.
- Feelings like insomnia and rudeness are carry-overs from other situations, lingering on longer than is needed. Try to let go off previous troubles and thoughts, forgetting all associated emotions before shifting your mental state for the next task.
- Concentration is of utmost importance for efficiently working on a task, so you must get rid of carry-overs from previous tasks, by visualizing "clearing the calculator" or similar images to get rid of previous thoughts and provide your full attention to your current, new task at hand.
- Get rid of your thoughts, worries and tensions by calming yourself down in your relaxation chamber, or "clear the calculator" to forget all worries and thoughts, and then visualize yourself succeeding to convey to your ASM the appropriate response required for your next task, before taking it on.
- All emotions, even positive ones like peace, love, friendliness and calmness carry-over, which is why it's good to retire into your relaxation chamber to restore yourself with positive emotions, to carry over into your next task.
- Practice these afforementioned techniques to build a psychic wall between you and disturbing stimuli; your feelings depend only on your reactions, so act depending on your goals and how you want to feel, rather than being swayed by the situation and your reactions to them.
- We should maintain emotional stability, being sensitive to negative feedback to help us change course, but not so senitive to the point that it swayes our attitudes and feelings.
- Another innapropriate response is responding emotionally to things that are imaginary, as they still cause the same emotions and our nervous system responds as if those things are real, adding more negatives onto the negatives that actually exist.
- When we worry about a situation, we create adverse mental images of what may happen, and then we react to these images as if they were reality, worsening our mental state and making things worse for us.
- "Doing nothing" is the proper response to an unreal problem, ignore worry pictures and emotionally be totally in the present moment, analyzing and giving your attention to the here and now.
- You can cure old habits of overresponding by letting the telephone ring, by delaying the habitual, automatic and unthinking responses.
- Relaxation is nature's tranquilizer: use your relaxation chamber to tone down nervous response and to clear your mind of innapropriate carry-over emotions.
- To improve your skill of not responding and remaining poised, imagine yourself composed and unmoved in various situations, like a telephone rinings, rants and raves--seeing yourself sitting quietly and unmoved, going through your daily tasks in spite of pressures of a busy day.

### Chapter Thirteen: How to Turn a Crisis into a Creative Opportunity

- Some people are really good at a sport during casual play, but "choke" under pressure when around an audience, while others seem to perform better under pressure.
- The difference between the two isn't some inherent quality that one has, but instead their response to crisis situations.
- A crisis situation can either make or break you, either providing you with strength, power and wisdom you don't normally have, or remove your ability and control you normally have.
- You can learn to use pressure and crises as an advantage to perform better by learning certain attitudes and skills.
- Though we may learn fast, we don't learn well under pressure, since under pressure we learn a very specific way to do something, which doesn't always come in handy.
- Learning and practicing without pressure is the best way to learn as it lets your mind create more general mind maps under a calm mental state, which can be appropriately altered and modified to suit any similar situation in the future.
- We should practice many times without pressure to learn properly, rather than overmotivating ourselves and jamming the ASM and interfering with reasoning under pressure.
- We should find safe ways to practice, maybe with simulated, synthetic pressure, so that you can learn effectively, and make it easier to perform during the actual situation. This is what boxers do by practice punches in front of a mirror (shadow boxing).
- Practicing without pressure allows you to express yourself freely without the presence of inhibiting factors.
- To use your "nerves" to your advantage, simply picture only your goal in your mind, concentrate on it and know that it will happen, allowing your ASM to automatically achieve that goal with your gained strength.
- By being goal-oriented, and wanting to go through the crisis experience to achieve your goal, you can do it by channeling the additional power to your advantage.
- Most people mistakenly view excitement as fear or anxiety, however you must realize that until it's directed to a goal, the excitement is simply a supply of emotional steam, but not any emotion in particular.
- Since this "emotional steam" has the same physical and physiological bodily effects, it is only up to us to view it as any particular emotion; we can view the feeling of anxiety or fear as excitement if we so choose to.
- Most people who perform well under pressure view this emotional steam as excitement, and so it's important to realize that this crisis situation feeling is an excitement that only boosts our performance, and its absense can cause its own problems.
- We should take a look at our crisis situations and ask ourselves "What is the worst that can happen?", to prevent magnifying the situation and overreacting to something of lesser significance.
- It's important to have the self-image of someone who responds well to crisis and is successful at finding oppurtunity in adversity, as that's possible for everyone to do in the right situations and that's how people perform well under pressure.
- It's okay if you do wrong on your first attempt, because then you have nothing to lose, allowing you to go all out on your second attempt and still lose nothing if you still fail. This however, more often than not helps people succeed at their next attempt(s).
- Focus on having a realistic view of crisis situations, before making use of the excitement and increased power to your advantage by having trust and visualizing the goal you want to achieve, effectively turning crisis into a creative oppurtunity, performing better under pressure.

### Chapter Fourteen: How to Get and Keep "That Winning Feeling‚Äù

- Our ASM is tele-logical, i.e. it provides the means when you provide the goal, and it does a much better job at achieving the goal than your conscious mind ever could.
- To kick your ASM into action, you must think of the goal as a real, present possibility, and evoke within you the feelings you would get if that goal were already achieved.
- When you worry about a situation going wrong, you're evoking the emotions you would feel if that really happened; all you now have to do is evoke emotions of success and then success will be interpreted as the goal and achieved by your ASM.
- The emotions you dwell on become your goal and your ASM acts in accordance to those emotions, so if you evoke feelings of success and fully capture it, you will act successfully.
- Conscious effort destroys spontaneous action, so instead picture images of your goal clearly and vividly, and then strongly capture the feelings you would get when that goal become a reality, so that your ASM can spontaneously work towards that goal.
- In the opinion of the author, when you have fully defined your goal in detail and communicated it to your ASM, you can easily achieve goals and enjoy the process if you fully release the responsibility of hitting the target to the ASM.
- You can build success patterns by starting off achieving a goal which is well within your ability, but captivating and fulfilling enough to arouse enthusiasm and motivation.
- You can reimagine past moments of success you've had in great detail, to fully evoke within you the feeling of success you felt once again, and then with this "winning feeling of success" imagine vivid pictures of your new goal, imagining how you would act and feel if you have already succeeded.
- Just like how you worry about a unfavorable outcome, toy around with the possibility of complete and inevitable success, starting by just supposing that it happens a few times, and then telling yourself how it's always a possibility, then imagine success in your mind over and over, adding small details and refinements until it all becomes very real and appropriate feelings start manifesting themselves.
- The process of "positive worry" as described above can be used to cultivate feelings of faith and courage.
- Never take counsel of your fears; don't think negative feelings are a sure sign that you will fail, because they originate from our own mental attitude, and your self-image and personality can always be altered to the true, positive, magnetic version of you, which means your negative feelings must be discarded at all costs.
- React to negative feelings and your own negative advice aggressively and positively, taking them as a challenge and striving to prove them wrong.
- Feelings cannot be controlled by willpower, so when you have a bad feeling, you must counter it by filling the mind with wholesome, positive, desirable images, imaginations and memories from the past, or your anticipation of the future.
- Your present thinking is influenced by your past, but similarly you can influence your past memories by your present emotions and attitudes; you can choose to influence your past by having a positive and pleasant attitude, to strengthen the success engrams and weaken those of failure and unhappiness.
- You can frame your self-image by deciding what kind of person you want to be, and repeating phrases in your mind stating that you are that kind of person, to cause your thoughts, feelings and actions to arise from this new self-image.

### Chapter Fifteen: More Years of Life and More Life in Your Years

- It is believed that emotional and psychological well-being acts as a "longevity medicine" by keeping you healthy and live longer.
- It has been theorized that humans have a certain "energy" that dictates why some humans live longer than others, or heal an injury faster than others.
- This energy is termed as "adaptation energy", which adapts to conditions by overcoming disease, healing wounds, etc.
- Lab experiments show that the emotional stress of frustration in rats makes it worse and sometimes impossible to heal injuries, proving that the AFM literally injures you.
- Across many patients who recovered quickly from surgery, one common thread across all differences in age, diet, pulse rate, etc was that those patients were all optimistic, cheerful positive thinkers who expected, and had a reason/need to get well quick.
- We know that mental attitudes can influence the body's healing mechanisms, since by the placebo effect sugar pills have been shown to magically cure many illnesses.
- By expecting to grow old at a given age, we might unconsciously set a negative goal image for our servo-mechanism, or by fearing old age we might cut out all mental and physical activity, both being factors which could contribute towards us becoming older.
- A basic need for all humans to live long, happy and healthy lives is the "need for more life": the need to positively look forward to the future with gladness and anticipation.
- Our life force is adaptive, evolving us constantly to cope with our environment, which means if we place ourselves in situations which need more life (important goal-striving situations), we will receive more life.
- It is believed that we establish this need by looking forward to the future with joy and anticipation, and when we have something important to do and somewhere to go.
- Setting goals and striving to work towards them, while having positive expectations and anticipation for the future will possibly provide you with more Life Force and keep you happy and healthy for longer.
- Develop a nostalgia for the future, an enthusiasm for life and a need for more life to receive more life.
- Many people go rapidly downhill after retirement, believing that their active productive life is completed. This is very detrimental however, since it kills their need for more life; we shouldn't retire from life itself after retiring from a job‚Äîwe should continue to be hopeful for the future and set goals, giving us more life.
- The Life Force is a mysterious, yet powerful force since it seems to cause miracles; the body's healing processes seem to speed up under the influence of intense faith, and in another case it caused someone who doesn't have the physical muscular structure to support walking, to be able to walk and move freely.
- We shouldn't blindly accept the conclusions of either religion, or science, but instead we should use our rational thought, mix and match from both, and test hypotheses for ourselves; scientific conclusions are indeed credible, but that doesn't mean that everything can be explained by science, and some things directly contradict scientific knowledge.
- Everyone's real goal, is for more life, fulfillment, and happiness, and we shouldn't limit the channels through which life may come to us, whether it be science, religion or psychology.
- The best self-image of all is to imagine yourself as having the potential of attaining perfection, being "made in the image of God". It is an insult to our Creator to say that his creations (us humans) are not worthy, important or capable.

### Summary of the Book

The book talks much about how we can achieve goals by simply communicating these goals to our Automatic Success Mechanism and allowing it to take care of the trial-and-error process to achieve the goal, and also that our self-image and personalities can be changed at any point of life, and we should aim to unlock our true magnetic, attractive, charismatic and dynamic personality lurking within.

You can also make use of visualizations to deeply imagine your goal, as well as try to immerse yourself in the feelings of success to reinforce this goal, because your mind cannot distinguish between a real experience and one that is vividly imagined. Visualizing goals in your mind also help train your subconscious mind for reality, as documented in a study where people got better at basketball free throws just by imagining them.

It also talks about how happiness is the normal state of the body and is a physical medicine for your organs, and how happiness cannot be caused by any one event, but is instead a habit that can be built upon. I also learnt the importance of alleviating all stresses and calmly allowing your ASM to work towards your goals, since trying to consciously focus and control creative tasks only hinders performance. Along with this, the book also talks about how humans are goal-striving creatures and that having clarity towards new goals and relentlessly persuing them using a positive-aggressive mindset gives us fulfillment and happiness, as well as allows us to live longer.

The book also talks about how our thoughts and beliefs shape our actions, and we act based on what we ********imagine******** to be true about our environment, which means we should always be optimistic and look for the truth in any situation, as we try to prevent ourselves from being negatively swayed by our opinions on any matter. On top of this, it also talks about how crisis situations of anxiety are beneficial for us, and that the ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù we think we face is actually just heighted emotional steam or excitement, which aims to provide us with more energy towards our goal. 

Hence, by having a positive-agressive and optimistic mindset, unlocking our true dynamic personality, making use of our situations and emotions well, acquiring a habit of happiness, by getting rid of negative emotions and instead staying calm, relaxed and present in the moment, and ultimately making optimum use of our ASM by providing it with well-defined goals, trusting it, and allowing it to do its work, we are able to achieve almost any realizable goal and live an amazing life filled with purpose, progress, drive and fulfillment, ultimately providing us with more ‚Äúlife force‚Äù to keep us going.
