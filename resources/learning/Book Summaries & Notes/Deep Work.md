# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences

1. The ability to perform useful tasks, with laser-focused concentration and high efficiency, that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit and create new value are of great importance if you wish to thrive in the current economy.
2. Distractions have greatly disrupted our potential to create, and by eliminating those distractions and providing unwavering concentration towards our tasks at hand, we end up achieving a lot more than we otherwise could have.
3. By efficiently replacing shallow tasks with deeper, more cognitively demanding ones that require deliberate effort, we can not only increase our work productivity and output efficiency, but also greatly improve our quality and enjoyment of life, as we will now have more leisure time to spend towards a structured, fulfilling routine of hobbies and activities filled with purpose.

# üé® Impressions

This book taught me the importance of valuing your time, and also how to efficiently increase your work output in less time.

I really liked the idea of tracking every minute of your day, and breaking each day up into blocks, as it allows you to better manage your time and gain insight into how your day would normally play out. It (along with fixed-schedule productivity) allows you to get more done in less time and lets you make better use of your time.

The most important insight I got from this book however, isn‚Äôt related to work, but to leisure activities. It says that true entertainment comes from doing something meaningful and worthwhile with every minute of your day, rather than feeding yourself with constant distraction from the Internet; it allows you to end your day feeling more fulfilled and begin your next one more relaxed.

> *If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all waking hours, you‚Äôll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured Web surfing.*

## How I Discovered It

I found this book as it was recommended by many self-help YouTubers such as Hamza, who preached the benefit of deep work, i.e. working for less time with laser-focused concentration and accomplishing more.

## Who Should Read It?

Although this book is mainly targeted towards knowledge workers and other such professionals, I would recommend both workers and students to read this book, since it provides great insight into many useful and indispensable topics regarding productivity, leisure, and even life in general.

# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me

```
üí° How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.
```

- I learnt about the importance of valuing your time and how to choose to spend that time in the most efficient way possible
- I also learnt quite a bit about the negatives of the Internet distractions and social media, and how it benefits us to keep away from them as it helps us improve our concentration ability
- It also taught me how mindlessly scrolling through the Internet and watching content isn‚Äôt true entertainment, but rather following a structured pattern of fulfilling and fun hobbies, with regular change and rhythm is what makes true, relaxing entertainment.
- Another highly useful activity taught in the book is ******************************************Productive Meditation******************************************, which is where you focus your attention on a single well-defined professional (or personal) problem, and regularly bring your attention back to it when your mind wanders away. Although this is taught as a technique to improve your concentration skills, it has a profound impact on making it easy to solve nuanced problems which might not be easy to solve otherwise.
- Another technique that I learnt to solve such problems, is simply relaxing during downtime, and engaging in activities like walking in nature, listening to music while making dinner, or going for a run. This works, because your unconscious mind is a lot better at solving and making vague, conflicting problems and decisions.

# üìí Summary + Notes

## PART 1: The Idea

### Chapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable

- Our modern economy has divided workers into two groups, once who will find it hard to survive and are easily replaceable, and others who will thrive and cannot be replaced.
- There are three kinds of thriving workers:
    - Those who are highly proefficient at leveraging complex softwares and working alongside technological developments.
    - Those who are very knowledgeable stars in their field, being the best at what they do.
    - Those with access to large amounts of capital for investment.
- To thrive in the new economy, one should be able to master new, hard things quickly, and leverage one‚Äôs mastery to produce at an elite level, in terms of speed and quality.
- Deep Work lets you quickly learn hard things, since intense focus makes your cognitive processess prioritize the task of learning.
- Deliberate effort is when you intensely focus on the skill to be learned, and use constant feedback to efficiently hone in on the aspects requiring most practice.
- When performing an activity, certain neurons fire in a specific pattern in a circuit to transfer energy, and the better myelinated the neurons are, the better you are at that activity.
- Intense focus and deliberate effort fire particular neurons repeatedly to isolate and strengthen (or myelinate) the neurons that are most useful to improve in that activity.
- When you shift from one task to another, there is a certain amount of attention residue that still remains fixed on the previous task.
- Intensely focusing as you work on only one task for certain periods of time minimizes attention residue, improving your output.
- High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent * Intensity of Focus
- Deep Work isn‚Äôt the only valuable skill in our economy, but the niches which don‚Äôt value deep work and/or better value shallow work are few and far between.

## PART 2: The Rules

### Rule #1: Work Deeply

- People fight desires and distractions all day, and making use of willpower to combat them is futile since willpower is a limited resource.
- The key to developing a deep work habit is not to work against your distractions, but instead leverage routines and rituals to maximize your limited willpower.
- There are four ways to schedule your deep work:
    - **Monastic Scheduling**: Cutting yourself off from the outside world and radically cutting down shallow work to focus all your energy towards one professional goal.
    - ************************************Bimodal Scheduling************************************: Dividing your time into deep work and shallow work seasons, to gain the benefits of deep focused work for certain stretches of time without cutting yourself off from shallow distractions forever.
    - **********************Rhythmic Scheduling**********************: Turn deep work into a regular habit, where you have consistent bouts of focused activity in a week, generating a rhythm for the work.
    - ****************************Journalistic Scheduling****************************: Spontaneously shifting into ‚Äúdeep work mode‚Äù whenever possible, as you make use of every possible oppurtunity to fit deep work into your schedule.
- Create a deep work ritual that you precisely follow during your every session to build consistency and make it easier to transition into deep work mode.
- For this ritual, ascertain where you will work, how long you will work for, how you will structure your work efforts, how you will keep your concentration and eager attention, and how you will support your work (start with a cup of coffee, or integrate light exercise for example).
- Make grand gestures and truly put effort into aggrandizing and committing to the quality of your environment and experience during deep work, to inhibit the mind‚Äôs instinct to procrastinate and to motivate your mind to making the most out of your sessions
- Prevent being distracted by other people, but discussing with people about the task at hand and working side by side might help push each either towards greater levels of depth. Make sure however, not to constantly look for random positive interactions as that might disrupt concentration.
- Focus your deep work on the wildly important goals, while actively working to progress the behaviors that will lead to those goals, rather than working to only achieve the goals.

```
In simpler words, aim to achieve specific main goals, and create smaller goals to work towards which will ultimately lead you to achieving the main goals
```

- Keep a compelling scorecard to track your progress and keep you motivated to working deeply in a consistent manner, and conduct progress reports at the end of a week to celebrate good weeks, discuss what went wrong in bad weeks, and how to ensure a good score for the days ahead.
- Try to achieve time affluence, and use your downtime to relax and recharge, thereby increasing your work output for the next day.
- Relaxing during downtime also can prove to be useful in resolving conflicting matters and issues in your mind, since your unconscious mind is better at tackling them than your conscious mind.
- Since intense focused work can only be effectively carried out for 1-4 hours per day, work done in evenings isn‚Äôt that important anyways, which makes it more efficient and beneficial for you to wind down, recharge and relax during the evenings.
- End each workday with a strict shutdown ritual, where you check off all the work for the day, and allot the remaining work for the next day, while maintaing a list of all tasks to finish in the near future. Finally, use auditory cues like ‚ÄúShutdown complete‚Äù to tell your mind to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day

### Rule #2: Embrace Boredom

- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill to be trained and cannot easily be acquired without any practice.
- Your ability to focus deteriorates if you cannot keep yourself undistracted under boredom.
- Multitaskers cannot filter out irrelevancy and so find it harder to be laser-focused on a task.
- Embracing boredom allows you to increase the limit of your concentration ability.
- Practice taking breaks from focus by setting certain periods of time throughout the day as internet-blocks for yourself, and avoiding distractions for the rest of the day.
- The aim of this practice isn‚Äôt to limit your internet usage, but instead to reduce your dependence on distractions and to make yourself comfortable with concentration.
- Try your best to not pull out your phone when you‚Äôre forced to wait (like waiting in a line), to further train your concentration ability.
- A few times every week, fully commit to try completing a crucial task a lot quicker than normal by setting a hard deadline that drastically reduces the time. This forces you to work with great intensity and high concentration.
- Also a few times every week, when you‚Äôre occupied physically but not mentally (eg: walking, showering, jogging), try to focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem and continue to bring your attention back to that problem when you notice your mind wandering.

```
üí° This is called Productive Meditation, and it rapidly improves your ability to think deeply
```

- When performing productive meditation, try your best not to be swayed by thoughts, reminding yourself that you will come back to them later. Also try to make sure you don‚Äôt keep looping over things about the problem that you already know, and instead try to dive deeper.
- Structure your deep thinking, by organizing the variables of your problem in your mind, defining the next-step question you need to answer using the variables, and finally by clearly reviewing the answer you arrived at, continuing this process over and over again until you come up with a solution to the original problem.
- Your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it.

### Rule #3: Quit Social Media

- The internet, and particularly social media worsens our concentration, and the best way to combat this is to realize that not all of the internet is bad, but some of it is; so it is necessary to lessen the use of services that cause negative impacts.
- You cannot justify using a social media app just because it provides ****some**** benefits, without accounting for their cons, and proving that the pros outweigh those cons.
- You should identify the core factors that spell success in your life, and continue using each social media networking app only if its positive impacts on those factors outweigh the negative impacts.
- You can do this by identifying your high-level goals, and then listing down important activities that help you achieve these goals. Finally, consider the network tools you use, and continue using them only if their positive impact on those activities outweight the negatives as stated earlier.
- Make use of the Pareto principle (80/20 Rule), i.e. 80% of the effects are produced by 20% of the causes. For eg, if you‚Äôre a writer who uses Twitter, the app might not be part of the 20% of resources that cause 80% of your success, in which case it might be wise to replace Twitter usage with a more fruitful activity.
- You can quit useless social media apps, by banning yourself from using them for 30 days, and if those 30 days would have been better if you used a particular app or a lot of people wanted you to continue using that app, continue doing so, otherwise quit the service permanently. Decide for yourself if you want to continue using a service or not if your answers to those questions are ambiguous.
- People on social media apps are generally delusional that everyone wants to hear what you have to say, and that everyone would be disappointed if they stopped using the apps; more often than not this isn‚Äôt the case however.
- To not give into Internet distractions, especially after a school/workday, put more thought into your leisure time; don‚Äôt default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead follow a structured, fulfilling routine made up of hobbies and fun, purposeful activities.
- True entertainment comes from doing something meaningful and worthwhile with every minute of your day, rather than feeding yourself with constant distraction from the Internet; it allows you to end your day feeling more fulfilled and begin your next one more relaxed.

### Rule #4: Drain the Shallows

- Cutting out shallow work out of your workday often proves to have little to no effect on the volume of total productive work output.
- By cutting down on shallow work as much as possible, while making adequate use of deep work, we can greatly increase our efficiency and amount of quality work produced.
- It is important to note however, that shallow work can‚Äôt be completely eliminated, since the limit to performing deep work and deliberate effort seems to be around 1 to 4 hours, and you will see diminishing returns upon trying to surpass that limit.
- Schedule every minute of your day, by allocating blocks of work and other activities to each hour of the day. The goal isn‚Äôt to strictly follow this schedule, but instead to track as well as try to minimize how much of your day is spent performing shallow work, motivating you to treat your time with respect.
- These schedules should be highly modifiable, and should be promptly modified when the timings weren‚Äôt able to be met perfectly. You can also make use of overflow conditional blocks to allocate extra time to the previous activity, if the block assigned to it might not be sufficient, or otherwise allocate that time to other unimportant tasks.
- Try to quantify each activity, classifying it as shallow or deep work, and if it is ambiguous, ask yourself how many months it would hypothetically take to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in your field to complete the task in question, to figure out which category it would fit in.
- If you work a job, ask your boss (or yourself if you‚Äôre self-employed) what percentage of your time should be spent on shallow work, in order to potentially reduce as much shallow work as possible.
- Set a strict deadline of stopping all work by evening, so that you can work backward to efficiently allocate your pre-evening worktime to getting all your important tasks done. This also allows you to prioritize deep work over shallow work.
- A commitment to such fixed-scheduled productivity forces you to better value your time, hence preventing you from blindly accepting any professional request or invitation that might be disruptive.
- Make use of ‚Äúsender filters‚Äù that make less and less people e-mail you, do more work when you reply to e-mails by aiming to favorably close the conversation loop as quickly as possible, and don‚Äôt reply to e-mails which are ambiguous, which don‚Äôt interest you, or are unimportant, in order to reduce the number of e-mails you send and receive, thereby greatly reducing the amount of time you might otherwise spend clearing an overflowing inbox.
