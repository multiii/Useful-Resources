> *When I walked into the dentist office that morning, I had come in for a free teeth
cleaning. And in less than an hour, I walked out paying over two thousand dollars for my
whitening kit and my new retainers. This dentist had strategically taken me through a
powerful process that I call a Value Ladder.*

> *Now, ideally we would like to sell everyone our best thing, right? You want to serve
your customers in the highest way possible. But the sad truth is that if I were to walk up to
you on the street and say, “Give me a million dollars, and I’ll help you to grow your
company,” you would either laugh in my face or run away, thinking I was insane. Why is that? It’s because we just met, and so far, I haven’t provided you any value.*

The goal is to create an instant bond between your Attractive Character and the person reading the email. If your first email is boring, you’re done. They probably won’t open the next one. But if you give them something interesting and hook them with an open storyline in the first email, then they will look forward to the next one, and the next, and the next.*

# 📒 Summary + Notes

## Section One: Ladders and Funnels

### Secret #1: The Secret Formula

- The first step to forming a successful business is outlining your dream client, whom you want to help at the highest level.
- Ask yourself the following questions to ascertain your dream client in your mind:
    - **Who Is Your Dream Client?** What does your dream client look like, how old are they, what do they look like, what are they passionate about, what are their goals, dreams and desires?
    - ****Where Can You Find Them?**** Which social media sites do they most commonly use, what YouTubers do they watch and what podcasts do they listen to, where do they get their daily news from, what other interests do they have?
    - **********What Bait Will You Use to Attract Them?********** What are you going to use to attract their attention and sell to them? Is it a book, a CD/DVD, social media platform, or a podcast?
    - ****What Result Do You Want To Give Them?**** Don’t ask yourself what product you want to sell them, but instead what is the end goal you want to help them achieve? What is the ultimate result you are willing to provide for them, if they were ready to pay you anything for that result?

### Secret #2: The Value Ladder

- To lure people into buying more and more expensive services, you should build a Value Ladder.
- The Value Ladder is a powerful process by which you attract your dream customer using a bait which is low in cost but provides some useful value. Then, you provide them with more value for a higher price, and keep increasing the value and cost of subsequent products.
- The Value Ladder works because when someone is provided with quality value, they will want to be provided with more value, which can be effectively sold at a higher price.
- It is imperative to start with a low-priced bait, because no one would be ready to purchase high value for a high price from a complete stranger right off the bat.
- The free (or cheap) value provided by the bait helps garner trust and rapport, which motivates them further up the Value Ladder in search for more and higher levels of value.
- It is also important to build a sustainable Value Ladder, and not just limit yourself to cheap products of mediocre value, as that will only limit your earnings by not tapping into your business’ potential.
- You need to make sure to have an attractive bait at the base of your Value Ladder, which provides good value at a very low price, so that you can entice your dream customers and take them up the ladder.

### Secret #3: From a Ladder to a Funnel

- A sales funnel is a realistic representation of the Value Ladder.
- In this funnel, the customers start at the highest level, the bait. Some of these customers advance to the next level, and some to the level after that.
- This process keeps on continuing until a few customers reach the end of your funnel, by purchasing your product that is the most expensive and provides the highest value.
- Some percentage of people will inevitably stop at a particular level of the funnel, and only a few will advance into the next.
- The sales funnel is the online process that you take someone through to get them to ascend the Value Ladder.

### Secret #4: How to Find Your Dream Customers

- Congregations are groups of people who gather together based on similar beliefs, values and ideas.
- Congregrations make it easier to sell your products to your dream customers as they help you easily with marketing to many of the customers in one place.
- To find the congregations of your dream customers, it is important to ask yourself a few questions:
    - **Who Is Your Target Market?** It is important to be as specific as you possibly can, because in the modern age it is very easy to distinguish users based on specifics such as their music tastes, or the movies they watched last month.
    - Be sure to create hyper-target messages, because people have lost the patience for generalized, mass-media messages. For eg: A pet store ad which advertises to dog-owners might not attract cat-owners even if the store sells cat food, because consumers want and expect messaging that speaks directly to them.
    - Really take your time to get into the customer’s mind and find out what they care about, what they are like, and what matters to them, if you aim to produce hyper-targeted messages.
    - ********************Where Is Your Target Market Congregating?******************** Since your target market is made up of real people, you need to look at their real behavior. What social media apps do they use, what influencers do they follow, what books do they read, where do they spend their most time online?
    
    > *I like to think of the Internet as a huge mountain, and your ideal
    customer—your traffic—is gold inside that mountain… gold clumps together in a vein running through the mountain (like a congregation)… If you keep following that vein, you can mine out all the gold.*
    > 
    - ****How Can You Get a Customer To Leave The Congregation And Check Out Your Page?**** You need to be good at grabbing attention and making your prospects stop whatever they’re doing to click on your ad. When you have identified your dream prospects and where they are, your job isn’t done. You need to make sure to attract their attention and get them to click on your website.
    
    ```
    💡 For ideas on the kinds of ads to place, you could go to Google Images and search for “National Enquirer headlines.” You’ll see hundreds of examples that you can model.
    ```
    
- It is important to note that your job as an entrepreneur isn’t to learn the best ways to run the ads, but instead solely to understand the strategy and then hire people who are great at the tactics, so that everyone can do what they are best at.

### Secret #5: The Three Types of Traffic

- There are ********only******** three types of traffic:
    - Traffic you control
    - Traffic you don’t control
    - Traffic you OWN
- The traffic you own is the best kind of traffic.
- The traffic you own is that which is under your direct influence (like email list, followers, readers and customers). You can send an email or post a message to your followers, and generate instant traffic at no cost.
- It is easy to sell services and products to traffic you own and earn pure profit.
- In general, each user in your email list is worth $1/month or more.
- It is highly important to convert the other two types of traffic into traffic you own.
- Traffic you control is traffic you attract via paid ads and affiliates. You don’t own them, but you have the ability to attract their attention and tell them where to go.
- A squeeze page is a simple page that converts traffic you control into traffic you own. This is done by giving them only one choice, to either give you their email or leave.
- Traffic you don’t control is traffic that just shows up, for eg. if someone talks about your product on an online post, their followers might randomly search it up and land on your website.
- Your blog websites should also have squeeze pages to possibly convert any traffic you don’t control into traffic you own as well.
- After building a decent-sized email list (traffic you own), you need to move them into your communication funnels.

## Section Two: Your Communication Funnel

### Secret #6: The Attractive Character

- Building an Attractive Character is important to attract prospects towards your products and services
- An AC is a persona you share with your audience, which is relatable yet attractive.
- The AC allows you to attract prospects, to sell to them the process that would take them from being how they currently are (generally what the AC was like in the past), to how the AC is at present (which is what they want to be like).
- There are three components to creating an Attractive Character:
    - Elements
    - Identity
    - Storylines
- The four elements of the AC are as follows:
    - **Backstory**: You want your AC to have a relatable backstory. Having a relatable backstory makes you seem real to your prospects, and they will want to follow your story; the story has provided a hook. The story has to somehow relate to the product that you’re selling, and by ending the story with the being AC in a good, favorable position, prospects will be ready to pay you to take themselves through a transformation similar to that of your AC.
    - **Attractive Characters Speak in Parables**: You need to make use of parables (little stories), because our mind better resonates with images. They help better illustrate relevant points in a way that is fun and engaging. These parables are stories that happened in your AC’s life, and are to be used to teach and inspire others, as well as sell them products.
    - **Attractive Characters Share Their Character Flaws**: This is an important point, because every realistic, three-dimensional character must have flaws. By creating a perfect, flawless character, you run the risk of your AC not being relatable. When the audience knows that your AC isn’t perfect, they will empathize with them more and like them more, because your AC is just like them: not perfect.
    - **Attractive Characters Harness the Power of Polarity**: Being neutral is boring, and generally if your AC is neutral, no one is going to talk about them. By being polarizing, you make sure people either love your AC, or hate it, and it will be the former who share your message and buy all your products. By being polarizing and sticking to your firm beliefs, you create a truly attractive AC (justifying the “A” in its name), which has both haters, and raving fans who will buy your products and services.
- Your AC will generally take up one of four identities:
    - ********************The Leader********************: It is the character who leads people from one place to another. They would have started off at a similar place as many in their audience, and so they have the knowledge it takes to go from where the audience currently is to where it is that they want to be at. These are the characters with a relatable backstory who aim to produce the same ultimate results in the audience which they themselves achieved.
    - **************The Adventurer**************: It is the character who is curious and seeks to know the truth, but doesn’t have all the answers. Instead of leading his audience through a journey to seek the truth, he shares the (limited) knowledge and answers he has collected from his own journey and experiences.
    - **************************The Reporter**************************: It is the character who hasn’t yet set out to figure out the process or “truth” that will let them produce the results that they seek, but they have a desire to. So, instead of finding it out themselves through trial, error and experience, they interview hundreds of people who are already at that position and have produced the results, and share the expertise they have gathered with the audience. This is a great way to start a business in a niche you don’t know much about.
    - ************************************The Reluctant Hero************************************: This is the character of the humble hero who doesn’t want to spotlight or people to know about his discoveries, but he does have the knowledge and secrets that many are looking for in order to produce the results that they want. Hence, a moral duty comples him to share the knowledge that he has, and he reluctantly does it.
- There are some effective storylines that businesses use over and over again in all their communication:
    - **Loss and Redemption**
    - **Us vs. Them**
    - **Before and After**
    - **Amazing Discovery**
    - **Secret Telling**
    - **Third-Person Testimonial**

### Secret #7: The Soap Opera Sequence

- When someone joins your mailing list for the first time, its essential to build a bond between them and your AC.
- You can do this using a Soap Opera Sequence, which is a sequence of introductory emails sent regularly to hook your audience and keep them looking forward to the next one, by using open-ended elements of high drama (just like a soap opera).
- In your sequence, you need to introduce your AC, and build a open-ended dramatic story that draws the reader in.
- There are a few principles to follow when it comes to crafting a good Soap Opera Sequence:
    - Set the stage by starting your email as a thank you note, introducing your AC, and letting your reader know how often they will be emailed (once a week seems to be a good rate).
    - After opening the loop, open the sequence with high drama, so that your reader is hooked right from the get go and then go back and fill in the backstory once the reader is hooked.
    - Your backstory must include your AC having been in a similar relatable position as your reader is currently in. Tell them the events that led to the high-drama moment.
    - The backstory should lead to a spot where the AC got stuck in an unfavorable spot, one your readers are likely stuck at too. You explain the backstory behind how your AC got stuck at this point, and then build further anticipation by promising them the solution to that issue.
    - Make use of an epiphany, saying your AC realized something they hadn’t thought of before, or stumbled across something that changed their life. Now since the reader is hooked, they will want to know and hopefully buy whatever your solution is, which should be the core product that you’re selling.
    - Then, point out hidden benefits to your solution that might not be as obvious at first, but help further reinforce their decision to buy your product or service. You should do this by the use of parables, to inspire them and move them to action.
    
    > *When the reader thinks, Man, I want that for myself! That’s when they
    click the link and buy your products.*
    > 
    - Finally, finish off your sequence by instilling some urgency and a call to action, to force them to give in and make that final decision, to buy or not to buy. You need to come up with legitimate reasons that will cause them to take action right away, such as a special sale ending soon, or seats being sold quickly. ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Do not fake the urgency, as it will backfire on you and make you lose all credibility.****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
- Make sure to pack your emails with a lot of character to showcase your AC well, and don’t fret if you made any mistakes in your emails, since your AC anyways needs flaws to make people relate.

### Secret #8: Daily Seinfeld Sequence

- You want your AC to be fun and entertaining, so that readers will be entertained by your emails rather than be annoyed.
- You can do this by using the Seinfeld email style, in which emails encompassing 90% entertainment and 10% content are sent to your readers everyday, after they go through the whole Soap Opera Sequence.
- Be entertaining and talk about your day: You can go through daily happenings in your AC’s life, narrate an embarassing tale, talk about your vacations plans, or anything else tied to your AC’s life. Make sure however, that the story has a purpose, and that you are able to tie in a product to be sold at the end of the email.
- Make sure to send everyone the same Seinfeld email on any particular day, instead of making users go through different successions of emails depending on when they finished the Soap Opera Sequence.
- You can still write your emails ahead of time, but you need to make sure to not send them on different days to different readers.

## Section Three: Funnelology Leading Your Customers to the Sale

### Secret #9: Reverse Engineering a Successful Funnel

- You need to understand at least four of these five elements by reverse engineering existing traffic streams:
    - Demographics
    - Offer
    - Landing page
    - Traffic source
    - Ad copy
- You need to figure out who your competitors are, where they are, and what they are doing.
- You can do this using traffic analysis sites like SimilarWeb.
- You could also look into purchasing your competitors’ products so that you can understand what kinds of emails they sell, what their upsells and downsells are, and what else they do to hook and retain their leads.

### Secret #10: Seven Phases of a Funnel

- It’s important to ensure that your prospects have a good opinion of you and understand what it is that you’re selling (pre-framing).
- You can determine this by figuring out how aware your prospects are:
    - They may not be aware of your product, but aware of a general idea of their problem
    - They may not be aware of your product, but aware of the desire
    - They may be aware of your product and that it can satisfy their desire
- Next you need to figure out who out of all your traffic is willing to hand you their email address for more information and value.
- **Immediately** after that, you need to figure out who among them are willing to pay for more value.
- If someone is willing to buy from you once, they’ll continue to buy from you as long as you keep offering value.
- Then, you need to identify as quickly as possible the hyperactive buyers, who are in some kind of pain right now, and are willing to spend on lots of products to alleviate that pain.
- After this, allowing some time to pass, you need to take them up your value ladder, ideally by now changing the kinds of funnel you use.
- You need to change the selling environment (eg: get them on the phone) if you wish to sell them a very high priced product, maybe even your core product for your dream customers.

### Secret #11: The Twenty-Three Building Blocks of a Funnel

- You need to make use of pre-frame blocks to warm up your prospects and put them in the ideal frame of mind:
    - Quizzes
    - Articles
    - Blogs
    - Videos
    - Email
    - Presell pages
- Then, you have to identify the prospects who are willing to hand you their email for value:
    - Pop-Ups
    - Squeeze Page
    - Squeeze Pop
    - Free-Plus-Shipping, Two-Step Form
    - Webinar Registration
    - Free Account
    - Exit Pop
- As said before, you need to identify the prospects who are willing to pay for your products immediately after the previous step
    - Free-Plus-Shipping
    - Trial
    - Tripwire
    - Self-Liquidating Offers
    - Straight Sale
- Next, you have to identify your hyperactive buyers, who are willing to buy multiple products to alleviate their pain
    - Bumps
    - One-Time Offers
    - Downsales
    - Affiliate Recommendations

### Secret #12: Frontend vs. Backend Funnels

- You need to start your cold traffic at a low-level funnel, so that you can warm them up as they go through your communication funnel.
- You can direct your hot traffic to your backend, as you provide them with your services of the highest value.
- Generally the higher up you are on the Value Ladder, the more involved your sales and longer your scripts will be.
- Traffic you control is directed to a squeeze page, while traffic you don’t control is directed to a blog whose top-third collects email addresses. Now, you send your Soap Opera Sequence to this new traffic that you own to build a relationship and trust, after which you can send them daily Seinfeld emails to help them ascend your Value Ladder.

### Secret #13: The Best Bait

- Using the word FREE makes the best possible bait.
- Try to sell products of actual value and importance for free, so that your customers will want to get more value from you and will begin to trust you more, at which point you can let them ascend your Value Ladder.
- Free-Plus-Shipping orders are useful because they provide FREE value, while making your customers pull out their credit cards to pay for shipping at the same time, making it easier to sneak in an upsell or downsell in the payment page via one-time offer checkboxes.
- Althought you might not like the idea of selling a good product for free, if you do it right you can reap major benefits in the backend.
